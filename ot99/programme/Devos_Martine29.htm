                Working with users trying to surface real requirements
(in terms of output not input), thinking about problems we often come in
<P>
situations where we feel that we do not get to the essence of the
problem, that we get information fitting an "espoused theory" and not
the real theory in use.
In our own practice we use words and expect others to understand them,
to give them the same meaning. Yet, we sometimes use these words within
a different paradigm (some mechanical, some more dynamic). Even terms
like pattern, or system thinking are used within different paradigms.
One of the problems with paradigms -- in our practice as in a business
domains -- is that words used in one paradigm may have a different
meaning in another -- without us being conscious of it.
We explore and experience techniques and methods for real dialogue using
<P>
metaphors and draw mind maps.

<A HREF=/ot99/people/mdevosargo-card.html OT=a>Martine Devos</A> recently joined EDS as Business Planning Consultant.
She was director of the IS-department at Argo since 1992 and before has
worked as teacher, as technical consultant and project leader to the
Belgian Minister of Education and the Civil Service.
As IS manager she introduced objects and she initiated, and coordinated
the development of a framework and several applications using it. Her
main focus is on the use of IS - and "softer software" - to support
change programs and learning.
Special interests are framework development, the use of patterns in
organization, the human side of IS and facilitating workshops.
She participated in, and organized, several workshops and panels on
System Envisioning, the use of creativity in requirements developing.
She is co-chair of EuroPlop'99.

adapt creative techniques and methods to facilitate dialogue and
exploration of new possibilities. We create space to surface and
challenge assumptions and learn from difference.  We learn to use
metaphors for sensitive reflection on concepts and methods. We share
points of view, we share assumptions.
We work together to adapt a method for requirements growing and system
envisioning to reflect on objects, patterns and ideas that influence our
<P>
practice.
We improve our techniques to represent ideas nonlinear using
mind-mapping and meta-plan.

<P>
Participants sit in a circle.
They are expected to bring a text or picture and to use that to present
some idea, doubt, problem or question about objects or something they
consider an absolute keeper or a misconception they want to correct.
Every participant -- NO fence sitters -- gets one (or more) rounds to
present a short citation, a poem, a photo a drawing... to talk about a
concept related to objects.
Presenters read their excerpts or shows the object or picture and
explains why this was chosen to talk about objects, his or her practice.
<P>
The use of metaphor helps to express (and detect) hidden ideas,
presumptions... that are not always surfaced using definitions. The
metaphors help place concepts in a larger context and may surface
different paradigms. Presenters are not interrupted.
The other participants take note -- using words and short phrases -- on
CRC-cards.
This way a map of concepts is build, with emphasis on strengths,
weaknesses, opportunities and treats.  Every presentation is followed
by a short dialogue working with the metaphor... stimulating
free-flowing inquiry.
Several rounds putting emphasis or questioning  concepts, problems...
follow. We use post-its with question-marks, exclamation-marks...
<P>
Unprepared latecomers can participate -- the facilitators will bring a
set of objects and pictures to choose from.

<P>
                The concept caf&eacute; is a form of gentle dialogue (based on
ideas by Peter Isaac -- the philosophers supper -- and Danah Zohar --
the concept caf&eacute;.<P>
Each person takes a quote from a famous voice, a picture... interprets
it, explains why he chose it, and shares some personal reflections on
it.<P>
<P>
Main goal is presenting and clarifying ideas using metaphors, mapping
ideas, presenting the maps and reflecting on it.
We do not work towards consensus.
<P>
Secondary goal is to experiment with this technique and improve it as a
tool for discussing a domain (has been tried in business domains).
