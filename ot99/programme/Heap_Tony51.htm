This case study examines a development project to wrapper the business
logic of an existing object technology application to enable it to be
accessed by many front-end applications using many different messaging
protocols. The application in question is a financial services
application, and the front-end applications initially requiring access
are call-centre applications, but the requirements for the project
involve the provision of a generic scaleable application server
wrapper offering well-defined business services which can be offered
to any client application across many messaging protocols. The
presentation concentrates on describing the architecture that was
devised to support these requirements and the design patterns which
were used within this architecture.

<A HREF=/ot99/people/theap-card.html OT=a>Tony Heap</A> has 8 years experience in IT. Since joining ECsoft 2 years
ago Tony has been involved in a number of mission-critical object
technology applications, and acted as senior architect / developer on
the business logic wrappering project described in this case study
presentation. Prior to this Tony gained a 1st class degree in Computer
Science at Cambridge University and was awarded the Olivetti Prize for
Excellence in Computer Science and an IEE scholarship in his final
year. He subsequently took a PHD in Computer Vision, specialising in
object oriented analysis, design and programming, principally in C++.

<P>1. Case study presentation - 60 minutes<BR>
<P>
Questions will be welcomed during the main presentation, but potentially lengthy discussion will be timed-out and picked up during the discussion session at the end, so that the presentation session takes no more than 60 minutes.<BR>
<P>
<P>2.Questions and open discussion - 15 minutes<BR>
<P>
Questions will be encouraged from the audience, as will comparison of experiences and discussion of lessons learnt by audience members and possible alternative approaches to problems of this nature.
