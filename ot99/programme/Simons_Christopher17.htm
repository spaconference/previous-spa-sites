<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE><P>
	The arrival of commercial systems trading over the internet has led to
an evolution of business process modelling and development styles.
	Traditionally, business process modelling has driven commercial systems
developments by describing what the system is to deliver. Business process models
have been typically used within an business enterprise where in-house business
experts are available to consult on requirements nuances, where the system is to
be deployed in-house, and trained user are specialists on their business domain.
Development processes have evolved to analyse, design and incrementally release
versions of software to in-house users with appropriate training.
	More recently, multiple delivery channels bring a range of evolving user
interfaces to static legacy systems. As specialist in-house expert users disappear,
who are the users? What business models should be produced for web applications? 
Does the business process drive the construction of the web  application or does
the application become the business process? Or vice versa? How is meaningful
prototyping and user acceptance testing conducted? How can the development process
be adapted to minimise the impact of transient Web page based interfaces on
components wrapping legacy databases?

<LI> Evolution of business process modelling to commercial web-based systems.
  The impact of changing user populations and roles, the applicability of 
  use cases to web-based business processes, the challenge of construction
  and deployment of scaleable web-base business systems over a variety of
  delivery channels.
