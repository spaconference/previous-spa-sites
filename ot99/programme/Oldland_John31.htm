<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE><P>
Lateral thinking was created by Edward de Bono over thirty years ago.
Its basic premise is that normal 'vertical' thinking is too quick to
dismiss ideas before their possibilities have been explored. Ideas which
may seem impractical or even absurd may eventually lead to better
practical solutions. While it has some similarity with 'brainstorming',
it is much more disciplined. 
<P>
Firstly, there are strict rules over what may be said at any time,
somewhat like writer's workshops. For example, group sessions can be
divided chronologically into differ periods of comment: positive
comment, negative comment, connecting ideas and points of interest. This
is only one of several ways of organising sessions.    
<P>
Secondly, there are a number of unusual ways of generating ideas, such
as unusual decomposition of the problem, reversing dependencies and
processes in the problem, and adding random stimuli. 
<P>
So what has this got to do with patterns ? Firstly, they are both
semi-formal ways of general problem solving; and secondly they have both
been criticized for being hyped and used in non-suitable problem areas.
On the other hand there are a lot of differences. Whereas, lateral
thinking is about creating new original ideas , pattern writing is about
discovering existing ideas and conceptualising them.
<P>
The session will compare and contrast these two disciplines. Lateral
thinking techniques will be explained and the audience will test their
applicability to different issues in software projects. We will then
explore the underlying notions of pattern writing and pattern languages.

Attendees should find some of the lateral thinking techniques useful,
both in solo design and group design sessions. They should also gain a
clearer understanding of what patterns arereally about and reassess
their use of them.

<P>
Three sets of posters will be produced: 
			 Problem solutions using lateral thinking
			 Appropriateness of lateral thinking to software
projects
			 What is pattern writing really about and why is
it useful ?

	Session will alternate between speaker presentation, group
working and group presentation to the session.
<P>
	I realise this proposal does not fit the mould of the
traditional OT session, and would therefore, appreciate shepherding.

An initial introduction will explain the principals of lateral thinking.
This will be followed by a short discussion contrasting this approach
with the use of patterns. ( 20 mins.)<BR>
<P>
	1.	Part 1 ( 1 hour 15 mins.<BR> )
<P>
There will then follow a description of some standard lateral thinking
techniques for generating ideas in the form of a part of a pattern
language. <P>
<P>
The attendees will be divided into a number of groups who will use one
or more of these techniques to tackle a one of a number of problems.
These will include software design, component interfacing, documenting
an architecture and creating user documentation.
<P>
Groups will present their solutions and discuss whether they found the
technique useful or not.  <P>
<P>
	2.	Part 2 ( 1 hour 15 mins.<BR> )
<P>
<P>Part II will look at writing patterns, using patterns and pattern
languages. I will start by asking "what is a pattern" ? We look at
comparative techniques in other disciplines.
For example is parallel evolution a good example of a pattern in biology
? Are algorithms very formal patterns ? How do patterns compare with
analytical techniques used in the fields of music and art ? 
<P>
 Attendees will be asked to come up with there own ideas and analogies
and then to answer some fundamental questions such as: Are patterns
invented or discovered ? Do patterns appear because there are generic
problems or is it only the solution which is generic ? Is it better to
describe the problem a pattern solves in terms of forces or motivations
?  What kind of structure should a pattern language have ?
