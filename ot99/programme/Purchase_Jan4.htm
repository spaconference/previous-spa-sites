</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Introduction</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>The increasing pace of requirements evolution together with the inevitable inaccuracy with which they are often captured is reducing the shelf life of developed applications or, at the very least, necessitating premature and expensive maintenance programs. Users — who have been sold object oriented development based on the promise of more maintainable, reactive systems — are now calling in that promise and demanding more and earlier changes to software, some before it is even delivered. To make matters worse, the same environments often have a culture of minimal requirements engineering, which is supported by this hectic pace of change.</P>

<P>Project teams that embrace an iterative approach to development have come to take for granted a constant stream of new and updated requirements from users throughout the project lifecycle. The wisest of them assume from the outset that users will have an incomplete or inaccurate view of what they require. Requirement engineers and developers protect themselves from this onslaught by building in ‘dimensions of freedom’ to their requirements and their systems. But how are these dimensions of freedom recognised and deployed? In this think tank we are going to examine the strategies used to cope with change and inaccuracy (which have different causes, but the equivalent effects) in requirements.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Objectives</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>Attendees will be asked to identify means of:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Detecting inaccurate or ‘slack’ requirements. That is apparently straightforward requirements that hide considerable complexity, risk or uncertainty.</LI>
<LI>Protecting projects from these inaccuracies by building in ‘degrees of freedom’. Using project management, architecture, analysis or design techniques to make systems easy to change within specified limits.</LI></UL>


<P>They will then be asked to use a subset of these strategies in mitigating the change risks in a simple project. The effectiveness of these strategies will be compared after the workshop by means of a simulation game.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Who Should Attend?</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>Project managers, architects, business analysts, designers and developers with experience of working with inaccurate or fast-changing requirements will benefit from attending the think tank. Those wishing to learn how to protect systems from change by requirements management, deep analysis and/or designing in ‘degrees of freedom’ are especially welcome.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Output</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>During the think tank attendees will learn about coping with change of requirements. They will split into teams and produce:</P>

<UL>
<LI>A poster detailing one technique for dealing with inaccurate and changing requirements, complete with the pros and cons of that strategy</LI>
<LI>A poster summarising a co-ordinated set of such strategies for coping with the risks raised by a simple project, complete with the rationale for choosing that set</LI></UL>


<P>After the think tank, each strategy set will be put to the test by means of a ‘project simulation’ game. During the game the strategy sets are exposed to a randomly generated set of tribulations (many from real projects).  Team posters will be adorned with the results of this game, which will show to what extent each strategy succeeded in mitigating change risk. </P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Structure of the Session</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>Firstly we are going to identify what strategies can be used to handle (minimize the cost of) change and inaccuracy in requirements. Notably:</P>

<UL>
<LI>How can we detect likely dimensions of change?</LI>
<LI>How can we alter our project management, analysis, architecture and/or low level design to make change as easy to cope with as possible?</LI></UL>

<P>Each team will be asked to devise one coherent strategy and define its pros and cons. </P>

<P>Then, using a simplified set of requirements from a real project, we are going to ask teams to choose a subset of these strategies that they would apply. The think tank will include an opportunity for teams to present their strategies to colleagues, complete with rationale. We will play a simulation after the think tank to determine their efficacy. Using real events from this project we will determine which team’s combination of strategies worked best.</P>

<P>The time is broken down as follows:</P>
<OL>

<LI>Welcome and introduction (10min)</LI>
<LI>Each team will identify and record a technique for handling change (25min)</LI>
<LI>Using requirements from a project, each team will then identify which set of techniques (from a predefined list) to use in a specific case (25min)</LI>
<LI>Each team will then present the technique they discovered and the set they propose to use in the project (15min)</LI>

<P>After the think tank:</P>
<LI>The game will be played. Teams will discover how successful their set of strategies were in the face of real problems experienced by the project</LI>
<LI>The results will be displayed as posters</LI></OL>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Materials</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>Attendees will be provided with:</P>

<UL>
<LI>A template for representing their change risk mitigating strategies</LI>
<LI>Materials to make their strategies into game ‘cards’</LI>
<LI>A predefined set of cards defining strategies that we have collected</LI>
<LI>The requirements for a sample project</LI>
<LI>Poster making materials</LI>
<LI>Rough paper</LI></UL>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Representing Strategies</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>The main purpose of this think tank is to identify strategies for coping with inaccurate and fast-changing requirements. Because the strategies will be tested in a game, they have to be expressed in a consistent format that determines how they interact with the mechanics of the game. This format is known as a strategy card. We outline this format here.</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Magnitudes and Factors</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>For each strategy that you identify, you must define the pros (how the strategy benefits you) and the cons (what it costs you). The pros and cons are each expressed in terms of a <I>factor</I> and a <I>magnitude</I>. A factor is the nature of the benefit (or cost). Possible factors are:</P>
<OL>

<LI>Ease of Maintenance </LI>
<LI>Ease of Persistent Object Change</LI>
<LI>Ease Transient Object Change</LI>
<LI>Ease of inter-Component Message Change</LI>
<LI>User Satisfaction</LI>
<LI>Runtime Performance</LI>
<LI>Development Team Commitment</LI>
<LI>User Commitment</LI>
<LI>Scope</LI>
<LI>Development Time</LI>
<LI>Financial Cost</LI></OL>


<P>Invariably all benefits/costs can be expressed in terms of the latter two, but try to isolate the factors most directly effected by your strategy,</P>

<P>The magnitude is a number between -3 and +3 as follows:</P>

<UL>
<LI>+1 indicates that the benefit of the strategy is slight</LI>
<LI>+2 indicates that the benefit of the strategy is significant</LI>
<LI>+3 indicates that the benefit of the strategy is very high</LI></UL>

<P>A negative number indicates the same for the <I>cost</I> of the strategy.</P>

<P>The magnitude can be fixed or conditional. Fixed magnitudes have an unconditional and set benefit (or cost) hence <I>Development Cost –2</I> indicates an unconditional significant monetary outlay and <I>Development Time +1</I> indicates an unconditional slight benefit in time to delivery. Conditional magnitudes only apply under certain specific circumstances (or are dependent on some event). Thus <I>Ease of Transient Object Change [+2] (requirement change requested)</I> indicates a significant benefit in the ease of change of transient objects, which only occurs if a change in requirements is requested. Notice conditional magnitudes occur inside square brackets and are followed by the condition under which they apply.</P>

<P>Remember: a card can have many pros and cons but, in the interests of simplicity, we ask that you express at most 2 of each. Usually they will be of roughly equal strength. Often you have a fixed benefit versus a conditional cost or vice versa.</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Parameters</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>Many strategies are either deployed or not. Some, however, can be applied multiple times. For example the strategy of using a pattern can be applied multiple times—its benefits and costs vary in direct proportion to how many times it is used. The ‘pattern’ strategy is parameterised by the concept that the pattern is being used to gain a degree of freedom in. Hence it can be used as many times as you wish with different parameters. </P>
