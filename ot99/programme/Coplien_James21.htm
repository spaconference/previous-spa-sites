<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE>                We talk about many kinds of software structure.
Different aspects of structure have been emphasized over different
periods of software evolution.  The intial focus was on data structure
and control flow.  Subsequent paradigms focused on data flow, particulary
in serial business processing applications.  Module structure unified data
and the operations most closely associated with it, leading to concerns of
coupling and cohesion. Objects have created many synonyms for these
structures based on allocation of responsibility, type models, and others.
In the mean time, other dimensions of structure address the allocation of
time:  tasks, processes, autonomous actors, and other aspects of parallelism.
Recent theories such as aspect-oriented programming, multi-paradigm design,
and generative programming are all attempts to unify many of these
structural aspects.
<P>
Structure is about architecture, and architecture is about structure.
Architecture has also undergone evolution over the millenia, with the
most radical changes having taken place in the last century.  Most of these
changes have been accelerated by availability of new materials and
advances in building and engineering techniques.  Each new style
brings new questions of utility, aesthetics, and durability.
<P>
Recently, Alexander has tied his entire Weltanschauung to the concept
of structure, offering evidence that it is the basis of beauty;  this
complements his long-held view that beauty and utility are inseparable
(i.e., Ornament has Function).  The pattern community is exploring some
isomorphic relevance of this theory to software:  how do patterns
and centers map into the evolving structures of software systems?

Technical Staff at Bell Laboratories and a pattern laureate in the
pattern community.  Jim is the author of "Advanced C++ Programming
Styles and Idioms", "Multi-Paradigm Design for C++" and he co-edited two
volumes of "Pattern Languages of Programming Design". Among his many
contributions is his highly acclaimed seminal work on Organizational
Patterns. He served as a program chair of ACM OOSPLA '96 and is a highly
demanded conference presenter and speaker.  He is a certified as a

<A HREF=/ot99/people/mdevosargo-card.html OT=a>Martine Devos</A> recently joined EDS as Business Planning Consultant.
Before she worked as director of the IT-department of Argo, as technical
consultant and project leader to the Belgian Minister of Education and
the Civil Service.  As IS manager she initiated, and coordinated the
development of a framework and several applications using it. Her main
focus is on the use of IS - and "softer software" - to support change
programs and learning. Special interests are framework development, the
use of patterns in organization, the human side of IS and facilitating
workshops. She participated in, and organized, several workshops and
panels on System Envisioning, the use of creativity in requirements
developing. She is co-chair of EuroPlop '99.

</TD></TR><TR VALIGN=top><TD OT=dt><H3>Topics</H3></TD><TD  OT=dd><UL>                        Interesting questions will be:
<P>
<LI> Are there strong isomorphisms in the evolution of these
  structures, or are the similarities incidental?
<P>
<LI> How did the role of architect evolve in each of these?
<P>
<LI> Is there a single metaphorical -- or even mythological - framework
  between these two disciplines?
<P>
<LI> What are the similarities and differences in the development processes
  for software and housing?  Software and office building construction?
<P>
<LI> How do the reuse philosophies compare between software architecture
  and the architecture of the built world?  How is each managed?
<P>
<LI> How far can the metaphor stretch?
<P>
<LI> What general things can be said about taking care in
  exercising the metaphor?
<P>
We will choose from among these questions based on participant interest.

</TD></TR><TR VALIGN=top><TD OT=dt><H3>Benefits</H3></TD><TD  OT=dd>                        This working group will strive to identify
parallels in historic developments in two schools of architecture -
building architecture and software. Does the parallel hold?  Where does
is break?  Participants will develop opinions about the applicability
of the pattern discipline at different levels of interpretation.
ranging from the codification of good practice to the relationship of
geometry to beauty.  We will also explore avenues for potential new
software development styles based on those used in architecture, such
as Construction On Site (as opposed to Prefabricated Housing).

                        Introduction of the session and the building
			architecture metaphore -- slides, citations,
			examples, pictures and drawings.
<P>
                        Subgroups work on the analogy with software
			architecture, focusing on a specific area
			delineated by one or two of the above questions.
<P>
                        We will alternate presentation of aspects of the
			architectural metaphor and the working groups
			over the whole workshop.
<P>
                        Creative techniques (analogy, force-to-fit,
			brainwriting) will be used.
<P>
                        Working groups produce posters of the
			software-architecture analogy.
<P>
                        In a plenum session we make a plan for future action.
