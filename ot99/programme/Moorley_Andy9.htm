<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE>Are architects and developers just the same sort of people but on different
 parts of their career path or are they
fundamentally different types of people.  In his book, Dr. John Gray
suggests that men and woman are from
"different planets" and that having understood this, more successful
relationships can be built.  In this session
we will consider whether a similar situation exits between those in the
team who are "architects" and those who are
"developers".

Let's be honest - most problems in software engineering come about because
of poor communication.  In this session
we will explore the communication problems that can occur between those who
 have responsibilities for the
architecture of a project and those responsible for the "coal-face"
development.  By the end of the session we aim
to have
<P>
<LI> Understood whether there are real differences between developers and
 architects
<LI> Gained an understanding of the likely areas of communication
difficulties
<LI> Created some process or organisational patterns (or at least to have
 looked an some existing ones)
       to help improve the communication between these two groups

Much of this workshop is spent in various small groups.  However, they will
 work in different ways at different
points as laid out below:
<P>
<P>
Architect/Developer profiles - In groups of between 3 and 6, we will
attempt to analysis the personality of real and
stereotypical architects and developers.  Three main techniques will be
available to the groups.  For those people
who would count themselves clearly in (and happy in) one role or the other,
 they can use one of the standard
personality profile tests.  Another approach for people who have fulfilled
or experienced both roles, then it it
suggested they role-play one of the stereotypes - and then either complete
one of the charts or simply create lists
of what the like-dislike about each other.  A third (and somewhat more
detached) approach will be allowed whereby
an initial list of descriptions (such as "forceful", "attention to detail",
 "abstract thinker") where will be provide
and they can indicate which role might be described as this.  The list
should be extended by the group.
<P>
<P>
TThe Group Therapy session, although mainly there to provide material for
later in the workshop, is actually a
valuable exercise in its own right.  People will be encourage to share in
an open and non-condemnatory atmosphere
their experiences.  Two models of operation will be offered (to suite
different personalities in the group).  One
model requires groups of there people.  Each person will in turn take the
role of "priest" (i.e. active listener),
"confessor" and "scribe".  Each person will get about 6-7 minutes in each
role.  The second model can accommodate groups
of 3-5 and is based on the "Alcoholics Anonymous rules" - (e.g. no
interrupting, no judgement etc).  Again each
contributor would be time limited.
<P>
<P>
When it comes to the main group work two choices will be offered.  Choice
one is to take one of the problems shared
by the group (either one which was resolved or one not) and investigate it
further.  Initially this will focus on
trying to understand the forces, thinking about exactly what the problem
was/is - and then considering the
solution(s) and any new problems created.  This hopefully will then lead
onto expression in the problem/forces/
solution/resulting context form of a proto-pattern.  If we find common
themes coming up - then may be we have
a new pattern which we can pass back into the Organisation Patterns work.
<P>
Choice two would be more suited to people who have less direct experience
to offer or just find this approach
more useful.  In this case, a group will be given a few (5ish) of the
existing Organisational Patterns and will
be encouraged to consider how these might help with the problems from our
shared list.
