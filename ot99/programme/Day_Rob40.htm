Acme Elephant Dentistry has expanded from its beginnings in rural
Bedfordshire to many branches throughout Europe and beyond. Each
national division is started as a copy of the parent, with its own
copy of business procedures and software. Now the
company want to go multinational so that they can deal with multinational
clients and work across national borders.
<P>
But with the passage of time, local business practices and software in
each national branch have diverged. They no longer talk the same
language and their software can't talk to each other. They have tried
to set up a central "software factory", but all sorts of wrangles have
resulted. A succession of managers and have failed to resolve the
situation. As the competition catches up, the senior management see
billions of dollars wasted.
<P>
Ultimately, a workable migration plan is found, but not without
considerable pain.
<P>
This session dramatises the experience of a real company known to the presenters.
