<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE>                        In this session I report on experience with the
development of a framework and applications for administration and on a
supporting method for incremental development and organizational
learning.  The framework helps us to develop applications iterative,
interactive and incrementally and allows us to focus on the process of
problem appreciation by both end-user and developer.
The framework is used to develop applications, which share a common
business logic and require database, electronic documents, workflow and
Internet functionality.
The framework allows to build increasingly complete specifications of
applications that can be executed at once. The resulting system can
easily be adapted to changing business needs.  The user can develop new
applications through modeling and configuration, rather than through
coding.
<P>
The framework is based on a repository on two levels. First, it consists
of a set of tools for managing a repository of documents, data and
processes, including their history and current status.  With these tools
users select applications, enter and view data, query the repository,
access thesaurus and electronic documents, workflow processes and task
assignments.
The repository drives the framework behavior. We store knowledge of the
business model, none of which hard coded. Tools consult the repository
at runtime. End-users can change the system's behavior using high-level
tools to change the business model. This way, we separate the
organization's business logic from the application functionality and
build softer software, resilient to change.
<P>
Since we can afford users to change their mind, inspired by the hands-on
learning experience of the technology and the new opportunities it
offers, we use methods and techniques from soft system thinking to
encourage users to reflect on their applications and to envision better
ways of working, even after initial delivery. To incorporate the
feedback we adapt both framework and the applications.
Support of a bootstrapping process was an important secondary design
goal: administration and configuration tools are now expressed in terms
of the framework.

<A HREF=/ot99/people/mdevosargo-card.html OT=a>Martine Devos</A> recently joined EDS as Business Planning Consultant.
She was director of the IS-department at Argo since 1992 and before has
worked as teacher, as technical consultant and project leader to the
Belgian Minister of Education and the Civil Service.
As IS manager she introduced objects and she initiated, and coordinated
the development of a framework and several applications using it. Her
main focus is on the use of IS - and "softer software" - to support
change programs and learning.
Special interests are framework development, the use of patterns in
organization, the human side of IS and facilitating workshops.
She participated in, and organized, several workshops and panels on
System Envisioning, the use of creativity in requirements developing.
She is co-chair of EuroPlop'99.

development, frameworks and/or learn from the do's and don'ts from a

to build a management case for framework development and on How to
engage users in using technology to support learning and change, to
engage them in writing documentation and training pears. Reflection on
the use of reflection in development -- strengths and costs/benefits
