This workshop focuses on guiding participants through the requirements 
specification process. The emphasis of this exercise is on making requirements 
testable so that they can be negotiated, communicated and traced throughout the 
project. The workshop explores the requirements specification as a set of 
interlinked goals, constraints and atomic requirements. Using Use cases as the 
container for business related clusters of requirements we can gather, 
communicate and test clusters of requirements.
<P>
Requirements engineering is by its nature a multi-disciplinary activity involving 
a wide range of participants. Requirements engineers must interact with both 
customers and systems developers, and this calls for both social and technical 
skills. The notion of making requirements testable is therefore crucial to 
effective requirements definition. It is a means of feedback from requirements 
engineer to customer in order to validate requirements, and a means of verifying 
that solutions constructed by developers meet the specified requirements.

Suzanne is a principal of The Atlantic Systems Guild. She has more than 30 years 
experience in systems specification and building. Current work includes research 
and consulting on patterns and the specification and reuse of requirements. The 
product of this research is Volere, a complete requirements process and template 
for assessing requirements quality, and for specifying business requirements.
<P>
<A HREF=/ot99/people/robertson-card.html OT=a>Suzanne Robertson</A> is co-author of Complete Systems Analysis: the Workbook, 
the Textbook, the Answers (Dorset House, 1998 (2nd edition), a textbook and 
case study that teaches the core skills necessary for systems analysis. She is a 
member of IEEE and the Australian Computer Society, on the committee for 
Object Technology, and is Roving Ambassador for the British Computer 
Society's Reuse Group.

In order to convey the realism (difficulties and solutions) of such a requirements 
engineering process, the format of this workshop is mostly interactive and 
participative. Attendees are guided (in groups) through the requirements 
specification process of a familiar (but nevertheless complex) computer based 
system. This guidance will be supported by the Volere requirements template and 
process constructed and refined by the Atlantic Systems Guild through many 
years of teaching and application to large development projects.
