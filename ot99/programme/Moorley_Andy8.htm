<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE><P>
More and more is being written about how patterns and
architecture are related.  People like Kent Beck and Ralph
Johnson were suggesting as far back as 1994 that "Patterns
Generate Architectures".  However, they were talking about
micro-level architecture being created by the sequential
application of design patterns.  More recently people have been
suggesting that when we look at large distributed systems these
sorts of patterns are at the wrong scale.  We have therefore
begun to see the publication of Architectural Patterns (e.g.
"Blackboard" in Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture and
"Isolation Layer" presented by <A HREF=/ot99/people/pdysoncoexis-card.html OT=a>Paul Dyson</A> at the Patterns 98
conferences).
<P>
Creating an explicit architecture for a system has many stated
advantages, but an area of key importance is how the
architecture will allow the system to meets it's required
quality attributes (e.g. performance, end-user functionality,
required modifiability, required reliability etc).
<P>
This session will look at two different (perhaps contradictory,
perhaps complementary) techniques for developing the architecture
of a system. The first is a technique builds upon what we are
calling 'Architectural Unit Operations' (small,well-defined, design
operations such as "abstraction", "resource sharing"). These are then
applied in a semi-mechanical process controlled by the desired
quality attributes to produce an architectural style represented
as a series of patterns. The second technique (taken from Extreme
Programming) uses a rather looser specification of the system's
required qualities and looks to 'grow' the architecture in an
organic fashion.

Paul currently works for Coexis (formerly Cumulus) on a project developing
a next-generation intergated front- and back-office system for the capital
markets using Smalltalk, Java, CORBA ORBs and an ODBMS. Paul has presented
sessions at a number of conferences (including previous OTs) on distributed
architecture, design variation and architectural style, software
frameworks, and patterns.

     Attendees pack (distributed 3-4 weeks before conference) -
     introductory reading, questionairre (who are you, what do
     you do, what are your interests, etc.), invitation to submit
     a case study. All optional - people can still attend if they
     have read and submitted nothing but useful for those that
     want to prepare.
     Slides for various presentations
     Exercise sheets
     "Crib sheets" for the design exercise for those who want a
     little more guidance.

<P>(15) Introductions, presentation on patterns and architectures.
<P>
<P>(25)      Breakout - Brain storm on architectural patterns seen by
     participants.  In some case people will already be involved
     in patterns movement and be able to comment on some existing
     patterns which they feel are "architectural".  In other
     cases we would ask groups to consider an architecture they
     know well and to see what sort of common ideas/design come
     out which could form the basis of architectural patterns.
<P>
<P>(5)  Collect ideas into central list
<P>
<P>(10)      Presentation on System Quality Attributes and Unit
     Operations<P>
<P>
<P>(20) Worked example: Deriving "simple" patterns from unit
     operations.  Based on Microsoft's Document/View
     architecture.<P>
<P>
[Break - 15 mins]<P><BR>
<P>
<P>(5)  Presentation on User Stories and organic system growth
<P>
<P>(25) Worked example: Organic development of a simple architecture
     from a set of user stories
<P>
Now some people investigate one approach while others investigate the
other, in groups<P>
<P>
<P>(45)      Breakout<P>
          For those looking at Unit Operations:
          Derive MVC architecture from unit operations. Apply
          further unit operations to create an improved
          architecture for GUI interaction.
<P>
          For those looking at User Stories:
          Staged development (on paper) of simple system specified
          by user stories. Iterative development of architecture
          and identification of patterns.
<P>
[Break - 15 mins]<P><BR>
<P>
<P>(20)      Report Back/Reflection
     Groups will compare, contrast and possibily combine the two
     approaches. At the end of this report back we will select
     one of the following next steps:
<LI> Work in two groups to investigate further each approach
<LI> Select one or both approaches and work on it or them
     (either in groups or all together)
<P>
<P>(45)      Groups work by considering architectural case studies
     (either provided by the organisers or submitted in advance
     by participants) to see if we can map between the
     required/observed qualities and the target
     architectures using the techniques investigated in the
     previous parts of the session. Where architectures differ
     from targets, how do they compare (better, worse,
     just different).<P>
<P>
<P>(20) Report back, wrap up and decisions on any future work.
