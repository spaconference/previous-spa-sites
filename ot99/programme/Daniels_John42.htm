<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE>It seems clear and obvious to me that
adopting a software development process based on evolutionary
delivery is by far the most effective way of controlling risk and
meeting objectives in software projects. However, many organisations
have not made the change, and many that have are only half-hearted
in their adoption. Evolutionary delivery is a software process based
on the following simple ideas: 
<LI> The development is divided into a
number of cycles, each delivering an ever-increasing subset of the
total desired system functionality. 
<LI> Early cycles deliver
functionality that is spread thinly across all areas of the system
and all of the hardware and tools, thus demonstrating end-to-end
capability. 
<LI> The content of each cycle is agreed beforehand and is
fixed. 
<LI> Users are involved in both agreeing cycle content and
reviewing outcomes. 
<LI> Cycle duration is firmly fixed. Although
simple, these ideas have a knock-on effect. They imply better
planning by project managers, higher commitment by users, and a
willingness to compromise by developers. 
<P>
The tutorial session will explain the principles behind evolutionary
delivery and set out a practical process by which it can be followed.
Unfortunately, most software organisations seem unable or unwilling
to apply the discipline required to make evolutionary delivery
successful. The same objections to it come up time and again, such as
"you can't deliver our system in cycles because it's only any use if
you've built all of it", and "it's inefficient for the whole team to
have to start and finish a cycle at the same time". I think it would
be very useful to examine commonly heard objections and develop sound
counter-arguments.
<P>
The think-tank session will do exactly that.

 Tutorial slides and supporting materials. Think-tank
results sent to all participants. I'd like to try to get think-tank
groups to capture their work directly on a laptop PC, to make it
easier for me. To this end I will provide Microsoft Word templates
on diskette. I hope enough people will bring laptops for each group
to have access to one - if anyone has any ideas on how to ensure
this, please advise.
