&nbsp;&nbsp;Workshop        </H4><H3 align=center>How to define common models when interconnecting diverse components; and how to ensure conformance.</H3>

<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE><P>
Building a common business model is the first step towards getting the diverse systems in a large enterprise to talk to each other. The same first step is necessary before building a kit of components. 
<P>
Many architectural teams start with a data or entity-relational model of the business. The benefit is that, once the corporation's systems are moved toward the common standard, information about a Customer can be moved from a spreadsheet in Sparshott to a database in Darjeeling and still retain the same fields (name, address, and so on). 
<P>
There are several drawbacks. The existing systems may have to be altered; it may be difficult to cope with extra information; but worst of all, the fields, though the same in all locations, may easily be interpreted differently by different applications. What an application in India does with the third Date field may be different from what's expected by a component in Canada. Local designers will tend to hammer their own data into the corporate standard form, distorting it on the way. There are also business rules that, without clear expression, will be flouted by individual applications, causing havoc in others to which the information is transmitted.
<P>
How should the architecture express these meanings and rules in a useful way, that will be adhered to in practice by application writers? How do we check conformance to them? How do we allow them to be extended locally, and over time? Object oriented definitions are some of the answer, though only part. And most published business modeling techniques say little about validating existing and new components against a common model.
<P>
We'll explore the techniques in this workshop. The material will be based on the Catalysis approach, of which the presenter is an author.

</TD></TR><TR VALIGN=top><TD OT=dt><H3>Benefits</H3></TD><TD  OT=dd>This workshop will benefit you if you are involved in:
<P>
<LI> Building a component based system
<LI> Defining how different systems or departments in your company talk to each other
<LI> Architecture involving several or many legacy systems
<LI> Business knowledge management
<LI> Quality Assurance in component or general system design
<P>
The workshop will enhance our understanding of:
<LI> How to ensure that business departments and software components can talk to and work with each other, and yet retain their own local terminology and procedures.
<LI> How to build flexibility into the model, so that it can keep pace with business changes, especially in terms of extensions and alterations in the rules.
<LI> Practical validation of a system or component against a business model.
