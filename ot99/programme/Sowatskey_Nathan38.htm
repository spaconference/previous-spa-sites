<H4 align=center>Wednesday 10:15
&nbsp;&nbsp;An architecture for independence</H4><H3 align=center></H3>
<CENTER><H2><A HREF=/ot99/people/sowatskn-card.html OT=a>Nathan Sowatskey</A></H2></CENTER>

The presenter has developed an architecture based on Java, CORBA and XML
which is intended to be platform, data and implementation independent.
<P>
The experience gained will be described in this session with an overview
of developing with Java, an examination CORBA design issues including
load-balancing and fault tolerance for servers, CORBA design principles
for services and the use of XML as a data description mechanism.
<P>
Participants are expected to have a working knowledge of Java and CORBA
and an understanding of XML (see other sessions for all three).
<P>
Prior reading of the presentation material and preparation of questions
will allow everybody to get the most out of the session.
<P>
The participants will have the opportunity to learn about the design and
implementation of a Java/CORBA/XML production system in detail and the
presenter is hoping for (constructive) criticism of the design and
implementation decisions made so as to improve the architecture.
