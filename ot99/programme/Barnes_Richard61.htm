        This session aims to show how to build the foundation for a 3-tier
CORBA
architecture by presenting a "middleware" layer, which is responsible for
managing
the distribution and persistence of objects in the application model.
<P>
        The session will present a generic framework for distributing
persistent
objects via CORBA. We will see how this may be used to distribute objects in
a
manner which makes the mechanism of persistence transparent both to the
application
server logic within the server tier and to the CORBA clients. The session
will show
how, by integrating this with a model for distributed transaction
management, it is
possible to build the foundation for "application servers" in the 3-tier
architecture.

        Attendees will gain an appreciation of the problems of distribution
and
persistence in 3-tier architectures and will see one possible solution and
how it
is extended to build a platform for scalable application servers.

<P>
        The session will consist primarily of a presentation. This will aim
to cover
the topics listed above without talking about particular implementations or
languages
and so should be generally useful. Coexis Ltd are currently developing a
system which
utilises many of these concepts for a major bank and thus have real-world
experience
to draw upon when discussing middleware; whilst this experience obviously
informs the
presenters views and opinions this presentation is emphatically not a case
study of
a particular implementation.
<P>
        The session should leave ample time for discussion at the end and it
is intended
that attendees will have opportunity to air their views and experiences.

        The session aims to show how to build the foundation for a 3-tier
CORBA
architecture by presenting a "middleware" layer, which is responsible for
managing
the distribution and persistence of objects in the application model.
<P>
        The session will start by presenting the architecture being
described and
discussing the mechanisms for distribution and persistence.
<P>
        We will then examine the difficulties in achieving this.
<P>
        A generic framework for distributing persistent objects via CORBA is
presented.
We will see how this may be used to distribute objects which persist in
ODBMS, RDBMS,
or other datastore mechanisms, in a manner that is transparent both to the
application
logic within the server tier and to the CORBA clients. The session will
examine how this
my be integrated with the CORBA transaction service to allow distributed
transactions
involving many persistent and non-persistent objects and resource.
<P>
        The session will discuss how such a framework provides a reusable
base platform
for constructing middle-tier servers, and the portability across different
ORB
implementations and databases will be examined.
<P>
Finally we will consider what additional facilities such as thread- and
memory-
management might be candidates for inclusion in this "middleware" layer.
