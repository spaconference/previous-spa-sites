<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE>   The tutorial explores ways of developing models of classes or larger
software components, which can be reused in different contexts. To
achieve this, it is important to represent explicitly what is required
by a given class/component.

 Franco has been a lecturer, consultant and researcher in object
technology for several years. He has presented the results of his
research at national and international conferences, and has written
several refereed papers in the area of object modelling. His current
research is looking at techniques for representing the valid context of
a model, in order to promote model reusability in different contexts
(e.g. using a component in different applications).

</TD></TR><TR VALIGN=top><TD OT=dt><H3>Topics</H3></TD><TD  OT=dd><UL>We model components rather than systems
Components need to interoperate correctly
A component model needs to represent what it needs from other components
<P>
Using the concept of focus or root of a model, it is possible to
separate the properties of a component from those that the component
requires from its context/environment

</TD></TR><TR VALIGN=top><TD OT=dt><H3>Benefits</H3></TD><TD  OT=dd>   The objective is to make the audience aware of the need for and the
problems involved in reusing models in different contexts and to suggest
a modelling approach in which the requirements for the valid context for
a software component are clearly represented and can be checked against
the characteristics of the reusing context. Participants will take with
them a set of ideas and techniques that they can immediately use in
their UML modelling activity, without buying a new tool or using a new
language.

   The session will be divided in five sections:
<P>
<P>1) introduction to the objectives and to an example model (15 minutes)<BR>
<P>
<P>2) participants work on their own, or with their neighbour, to make
parts of the model more reusable (15 minutes)<BR>
<P>
<P>3) participants are invited to share their results (15 minutes)<BR>
<P>
<P>4) a modelling technique is introduced to make models reusable (20
minutes), and its application to the modelling problem is presented
<P>
<P>5) discussion session on the merits of the technique or any other
approach contributed by the audience (10 minutes)<BR>
