<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE>Over the years many areas of object technology have been hailed  as the current  'silver bullet'.  This goldfish bowl
will debate which of these we will still be talking about and using
in the next millenium, whether perhaps object technology is now pass&eacute;
and  what will be the next hot topic in the OT field.

Usual goldfish bowl style.                        5 minutes introductions and explanations of how a
goldfish bowl works
                        5 minutes for initial discussion group statements
                        60 minutes discussion
                        5 minutes wrap up
<P>
                        Additionally either myself or a volunteer will note
down comments of particular interest on a flip chart, so forming the basis
of a poster.
<P>

</TD></TR><TR VALIGN=top><TD OT=dt><H4>Structure</H4></TD><TD  OT=dd>
                        An intial, small discussion group of 4 or 5 people,
will be set up with the rest of the participants forming an audience.
Spare places in the discussion group will be available, and members of the
audience may take up these places when they feel they have a contribution to
make. Members of the discussion group leave their places when they have had
their say, making room for new participants.
<P>
The initial discussion group will be formed from people attending OT99 who
are confident in this style of setting.  They will be primed beforehand and
asked to start by making a brief, 60 second statement. I will act as facilitator
and have available some additional comments and questions available should
the discussion flag.<P>
