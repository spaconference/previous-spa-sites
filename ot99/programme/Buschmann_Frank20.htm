<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE>		We present in detail a part of a concrete real-world 
		system and how it is designed with patterns: the
		functional core of a warehouse management system.
		Step by step we will re-play the process of the system's 
		construction. We discuss the design problems 
		that occur, shortly present the patterns that could help 
		solving these problems, and show how we actually 
		applied the patterns we selected. 
		
		By this we will see how the design of the
		system slowly grows and evolves towards the final 
		architecture. We will also see and discuss how patterns 
		are applied in practise and how they help building 
		high-quality software with predictible properties. 
			
		The case study concludes with a summary of our experiences 
		from several projects in which we applied patterns: 
		what worked, what could be improved, and what did we learn.

			Generally, a tutorial like style, but trying to

			asking about implications of applying a particular
			pattern, responding to questions, etc.
