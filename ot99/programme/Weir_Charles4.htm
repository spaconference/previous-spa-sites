<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE>Traditional OO programming depends strongly on the concept of an
objectís identity; to invoke a message to an object one must have access
to its identity.  Different systems implement identity in different
ways: as memory pointers or table indices or as file offsets, to name
but three.  <p>
Distributed systems and OO databases keep the same OO concepts as the
programming languages they reflect, including message invocation and
identity. They must, to be easy for an OO programmer to use.  However
because they have a much more complicated environment, these concepts
become strained.  Message invocation is no longer simple ñ the system
responsible for the remote object may not be there.   And identity is no
longer such a simple concept ñ for example:<p>
<ul>
<li>If a process caches a local copy of an object, where is the 'real'
object?  When does the distinction matter?
<li>How can we guarantee that two processes accessing the same object
see the same thing?
<li>What is the relationship between identity and transactions?
</ul>

Charles Weir has more than eleven years' experience of working on
Software Development projects and has been using object-oriented
techniques for more than seven.  As a consultant software architect, he
has provided on-site mentoring to many companies in several different
countries.  In each company he worked with the teams and individual
developers to facilitate the introduction of object-oriented skills and
techniques. <p>
Charles has also been responsible for writing and giving courses in C++
and OO Design for many organisations in the UK and abroad.  He has
designed and given several one-day workshops in OO techniques,
particularly concentrating on the theoretical and practical issues of
using o-o techniques in practical projects.

<H3>Benefits</H3>Delegates will work together to explore these issues.   By studying the
issues in the context of a a specific case study, we'll learn some of
the practical aspects to the problem, and the solutions people have
found effective.  <p>
The final session, in which the groups will produce and present posters
of their findings, will ensure that every attendee learns a little from
the experiences of everyone in the workshop.
