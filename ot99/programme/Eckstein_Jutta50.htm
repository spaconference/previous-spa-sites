<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE>Often people using a framework aren¹t the framework¹s authors. In addition, frameworks are almost always rather complex, and grasping the framework¹s underlying concepts is generally a major challenge and barrier to their effective application. Trainers need a set of guidelines for how to train new users unfamiliar with frameworks¹ architecture, so they are able to understand the underlying concepts, and are able to use and adapt the framework. The goal of this paper is to show how different techniques emphasize different aspects of the architectural design of a framework, and how these techniques can be combined into a general framework instruction method.

The process of training and educating people in object oriented design frameworks is a task with many unsolved problems. While many ideas are presented at OO conferences and published in journals each year about framework design, relatively little attention has been  paid to effective techniques for educating people in using frameworks.

<A HREF=/ot99/people/jecksteinacm-card.html OT=a>Jutta Eckstein</A> is an independent trainer and consultant in the area of object-oriented application development. She develops object-oriented software since 1990 and has worked for Integral Development and ParcPlace Systems (today ObjectShare) for many years also as a trainer and consultant. Before becoming an engineer, Jutta completed a pedagogical study to become a teacher.

Teaching and learning a framework should be strongly related to the
chararcteristics - the white Box and the Black Box aspect - of a
framework. Black Box teaching is strongly related to Requirement
Analysis in OOAD. It helps to clarify the scope and boundary of a
framework. Whereas White Box teaching considers the inherent
architecture by focussing either on the design patterns inside the
framework or on the Hot Spots, the points of predefined refinement.
<P>
The combination of these teaching techniques allows the training
process to progressively dive into the framework. The basic idea for
this combination is the incremental teaching approach, which discusses
a complex framework by using several smaller and simpler frameworks
and patterns. With each part the students learn, they become
progressively more familiar with the context of the framework and the
possibilities the framework offers them.
