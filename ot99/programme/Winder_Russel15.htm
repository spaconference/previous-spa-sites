	Patterns are currently an in vogue topic.  There are many
	books on specific patterns and/or collections of patterns, but
	there seems to be little on <B>how</B> to actually use them in
	a real project. In many organisations they are used on an
	ad-hoc basis. This workshop addresses these deficiencies.

	I am Professor of Computing Science at KCL.  My research
	interests center on the development of object-oriented
	systems, mostly parallel or distributed; this includes
	technical and human--computer interaction issues in analysis,
	design and implementation notions.  I am involved in the
	development of various helth informatics systems.  For more
	information see <a ref="http://www.dcs.kcl.ac.uk/staff/russel/">

	<B><A HREF=/ot99/people/jpurchasemagi-card.html OT=a>Jan Purchase</A></B> has been designing and implementing object
	systems since 1988. He has extensive experience of mentoring,
	teaching and, above all, using object design and
	implementation techniques within banks and the public service
	industries in the UK and the US. Since 1994 he has enjoyed
	leading roles in financial institutions involving the design
	and development of extensible and flexible software
	structures.  He is currently designing just such a framework
	for Bankers Trust's Derivatives Trading Group. His job title
	has featured the word `architect' for four years.

	By attending this workshop attendees will obtain a better

	should be used in the context of a development process.

	Participants will be divided into teams of 4-5 with randomized
	experience of patterns.  The centre-peice of the workshop is a
	design exercise built to make people think about how they use
	patterns and how this might be improved
