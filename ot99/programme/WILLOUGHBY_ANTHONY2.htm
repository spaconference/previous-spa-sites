<H1 align=center>Business modelling with UML.</H1>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Workshop 150 minutes</H4><H3 align=center>How to use the techniques in the UML to analyse and document business processes.

<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE>The main aim of the UML is to provide a set of techniques for modelling software in an object oriented manner.  It has been claimed, however, that these techniques could be applied to almost any domain.  Some of the techniques (e.g. business process extensions to use cases) have been enhanced to make them more suitable for the business domain.  This is particularly relevant to describing processes which make use of software systems as well as more human-oriented tasks.
<P>
The tutorial part will describe the main techniques available in the UML, with examples of their use.  One or two non-UML techniques will be described briefly for comparison.  The utility of the domain object model will be emphasised as a way of providing rigour.  Finally the relationship between business and system models, for business processes which incorporate software systems, will be explored.
<P>
The workshop part will consist of the participants dividing into groups and analysing a simple and well understood process using technique(s) of their choosing.  Selected groups will then present their findings, enabling participants to actively compare the effectiveness of the approaches used.
