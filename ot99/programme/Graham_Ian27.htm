<H1 align=center>Is there a difference betwen Objects and Components?</H1>

<P align=left>
This session will explore the issue of whether the recent emphasis on
components is justified as something genuinely different from object
technology or merely supplier-motivated hype.  Participants will be invited
to air their opinions and debate this and the following auxiliary
questions:
<UL><LI> What exactly is the difference, if any, between a component and an
object?
<LI> Do components delivered as binaries which cannot be modified by
inheritance throw away most of the advantages of object-oriented
programming?
<LI> What is the ideal granularity of components, if there is one?
<LI> What effect does the component viewpoint have on language design and
language selection?
<LI> Are IDL semantics rich enough to describe 'business object' components?
<LI> What are the implications for object-oriented methods?
</UL>
This session will appeal to all developers working in environments that
include the possibility of component-based development using CORBA, Active
X, Java, C++, Eiffel, or similar.  Managers making strategic or product
purchasing decisions will also benefit from the discussion.
