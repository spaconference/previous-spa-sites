            Do you have any patterns or pattern languages that
            you have sketched out or documented in a fuller
            pattern form? Unsure of how to take it further?
            Hard as it is to cast a pattern into written form,
            it is harder still to refine it on one's own; the
            greatest asset you can never provide yourself with
            is another pair of eyes.
            
            The patterns community uses the Pattern Writers'
            Workshop to provide a comfortable environment in
            which authors may review each others work, providing
            reinforcement of a pattern's strengths and constructive
            comments for improvement.
            
            This work group is intended to provide an opportunity
            to work with others to review and improve your patterns
            and theirs. The exposure to many different kinds of
            pattern and form can also be a great benefit, so there
            is no constraint on the type of pattern or pattern
            language submitted to this session.

    I am a Senior Technologist with QA Training, specialising
    in programming languages and architectures. Before this my
    background was principally in engineering and soft real-time
    systems. The buzzwords of interest here are C++, OOD,
    frameworks, multithreading and distribution.
    
    There's a lot that interests me, but an enduring theme has
    been design and implementation techniques, particularly
    within an OO context. The use of patterns in general, and
    not simply design patterns, has dominated my interest for a
    number of years. Beyond their simple application, I am
    interested in the relationships that many patterns have to
    each other and the subtle dependencies they have on context
    -- for instance when constrasting idioms in different
    languages, language models or technologies.

<LI> Beyond the expectation that topics for submitted patterns
              and pattern languages focus on the contemporary and
              traditional themes of the OT conference, there are no
              other constraints on the topics for submission.

            Patterns and pattern languages are based on discovery and
            experience rather than invention, and they are principally
            about communication. Given this, they naturally invite
            themselves for review by others working to the same end.
            
            There is a lot more to casting a pattern or language in form
            than simply having the idea. Working with other authors
            provides you with an ideal opportunity to explore form and
            content with like minded people.
            
            One feature often missing from other review approaches is
            lack of positive feedback on features in your work that
            are good; too often only the negative points are focused
            on. This is detrimental to both how the author feels about
            the review, as well as to the work -- unless strengths are
            highlighted they may be revised away in subsequent reworking.
            
            For non-authors, it is a chance to see a pattern writers'
            workshop in action, hopefully inspiring you to cast some
            of your own insights in pattern form. However, whether or
            not non-authors are invited to participate in offering
            feedback during the sessions will be at the discretion of
            those submitting work to be reviewed.
            
            For authors, the key benefit at the end of this workgroup
            will be... more work! The feedback you will have received
            should inspire you to refine your pattern. You will also
            walk away with the feeling of having contributed to other
            work, and the learning and insight involved in that process.

            Guidelines for the running of the workgroup, ie the suggested
            structure of each workshop session based on PLoP workshop format,
            will be distributed to each participant.
            
            Copies of all the material to be reviewed will be circulated to
            all attendees before the workgroup.

            PLoP style writers workshop, with the lead moderator handling
            session logistics and moderating at least the first paper. Other
            authors will have the opportunity, if they so wish, to moderate
            sessions.
            
            Authors will be encouraged to make their revised material
            available after the conference (the web being the most obvious
            medium), but in the scope of the conference a summary of the
            patterns and pattern languages reviewed should be made
            available as posters.

            Review sessions will last between 30 and 60 minutes,<BR>
            depending on the size of the individual work to be
            reviewed. For instance, pattern with a brief and simple
            form may take up to 30 minutes,<BR> whereas a pattern
            language may take of the order of an hour. The proposed
            timings and order will be fixed once all of the
            submissions are in.
            <P>
            The roles for each session are as follows:
            <P>
<LI> Session moderator
<LI> Author
<LI> Workshop participants (other authors)
<LI> Visitors (non-authors)
            <P>
            The process for each session is roughly as follows:
            <P>
<LI> Introduction by the session moderator
<LI> Reading from the paper by the author
<LI> Summary of paper by another participant
<LI> Positive feedback
<LI> Suggestions for improvement
<LI> Author feedback
<LI> Closing
            <P>
            There will be breaks between each paper.
            <P>
            In advance of the workgroup a shepherding process will
            be used to assist authors in pulling together their
            pattern or pattern language paper.
