<h3 align="center">The destiny of server-side components - a blow-by-blow comparison of
the major contenders</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>As the component market has matured, attention has turned to use of server-side
  components. Particular attention has been focused on providing transactional environments
  for business components. The two main proposed solutions in this area are Sun's Enterprise
  JavaBeans (EJB) and Microsoft's Transaction Server (MTS). In addition to transactions,
  these environments address important issues such as object pooling and thread
  synchronisation. </p>
  <p>This tutorial will examine the requirements for a server-side component infrastructure,
  such as object/resource pooling, locating services, object lifecycle, state management,
  portability and interoperability. The two environments will then be examined to identify
  strengths and weaknesses in each area. Also, development choices and deployment issues in
  each environment will be examined. </p>

    server-side components which can be used when judging products and services in this space.
    Participants who will be implementing this type of system will also be able to judge which
    architecture is most suited to their requirements. <table width="100%" OT="limits">

      <p>After the introduction and outline of the session, the attendees will form teams to
      generate an idealised framework for server-side components. This will define, amongst
      other things, the environment and services provided for such components, ease of
      deployment and ongoing management.</p>
      <p>Once the framework is developed, two short sessions will outline the primary structure
      and capabilities of EJB and MTS/COM+. This should provide ammunition for those unfamiliar
      with one or both to use when comparing them to the framework.</p>
      <p>Finally, a group discussion will use the framework as a benchmark against which to
      compare both EJB and MTS/COM+.</p>
