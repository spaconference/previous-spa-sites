<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE>Extreme Programming (XP) is a software development discipline created
by Kent Beck, Ward Cunningham and others, with much informative
experience arising from the highly successful C3 (Chrysler
Comprehensive Compensation) project at Chrysler Autos in the US. XP
turns the traditional development methodologies on their heads: there
is <I>no</I> documentation, code-level commenting is frowned on, no-one
practices code ownership, there is very little in the way of
<I>explicit</I> design,  programmers and the practice of programming
are aggressively promoted. In fact aggression (positive aggression
directed at solving the problem in hand) is a theme: the XP promoters
love to use bold statements like 'you ain't gonna need it' and 'the
source code is the design'. The development process is highly
iterative, the XP guidelines are lovingly refined and firmly enforced:
either you're doing XP or you're not. This workshop will look at the XP
as a whole, explore the underlying principles of the method and provide
opportunities for practical experience of the XP style of software
development.

Ltd.) where he is part of a project developing a next-generation
integrated front- and back-office system for the capital markets using
Smalltalk, Java, CORBA ORBs and an ODBMS. Paul has presented sessions
at a number of conferences (including previous OTs) on distributed
architectures, architectural variation and style, software frameworks,
and patterns.

</TD></TR><TR VALIGN=top><TD OT=dt><H3>Topics</H3></TD><TD  OT=dd><UL>The workshop will cover the guiding principles of XP:
<P>
<LI> The four things that really matter
<LI> You ain't gonna need it
<LI> Do the simplest thing that could possibly work
<LI> Spike the solution
<LI> User stories
<LI> Test as specification
<LI> Refactoring and continuous integration
<LI> Pair programming
<LI> Code formatting
<LI> CRC cards for communication and design
<P>
</UL>
</TD></TR><TR VALIGN=top><TD OT=dt><H3>Benefits</H3></TD><TD  OT=dd>Participants will understand the motivations behind XP and the (perhaps
paradoxical) discipline needed to ensure its effective application. XP
captures the essential creativity of programming and provides an
environment in which this can be harnessed by larger groups of
developers: the session will provide both experience and food for
thought on the nature of development, team interaction, and quality in
software.
<P>
<P>
<TABLE width=100% OT=limits><TR BGCOLOR=80ffff><TD width=20%><B>Level:</B> intermediate</TD><TD><B>Audience:</B> Anyone who is or has been a developer. Anyone coming should be experienced with either Smalltalk, Java or both and be prepared to role their sleeves up and get coding.</TD></TR></TABLE>
</TD></TR><TR VALIGN=top><TD OT=dt><H4>Material</H4></TD><TD  OT=dd>
Presentation materials will be available for conference materials. A
detailed workbook for the session itself will be produced: this will
contain all the material required for programming games and challenges.
<P>
The programming part of the workshop will require eight (laptop or
desktop) PCs. At least four of these can be provided by the presenters:
others will need to be provided by attendees or by sponsors: steps are
in hand to ensure that the machines can be sourced. Software for the
workshop comprises:
<P>
<LI> Smalltalk - Squeak Smalltalk
<LI> Java - a Java IDE
<P>
An evaluation version of one of the commercial IDEs (such as Symantec, or 
Visual Age) will be sufficient. The presenters will provide installation 
media for all software: this will be installed on participating machinesin 
advance of the workshop.
<P>

</TD></TR><TR VALIGN=top><TD OT=dt><H4>Delivery</H4></TD><TD  OT=dd>
Given the largely practical nature of this workshop there will be
little opportunity for formal deliverables from this workshop. However,
observations gathered by participants during the programming games and
the reflection session will be summarised on a poster for display at
the conference.
<P>
The workshop organisers will propose a BOF as a follow-up session to
give attendees and other delegates the oportunity to explore XP in the
context of a more extended challenge.

</TD></TR><TR VALIGN=top><TD OT=dt><H4>Format</H4></TD><TD  OT=dd>
Two halves, 15 min break between them:
<B>First half:</B> a number of (very) short presentations on the XP
guidelines interspersed with short programming games. Some of these
games are played in pairs as pen-and-paper exercises: others may
involve a pair working at a computer with another pair observing
(watching for evidence of XP, writing down XP idioms, recovering,
etc.).
<P>
Subjects for programming games might include: reversing a string,
testing for the primality of a number, implementing a map preserving
order of insertion, encoding/decoding strings, substring matching and
replacing. Some of these will be set up to explore the dynamics of pair
programming, some testing (for example, two teams each produce test
code for theproblem: the test code is exchanged, the teams then
implement the functionality to support the tests).
<P>
<B>Second half:</B> a programming challenge designed to exercise the XP
principles - groups have to build a system in very short time. The
challenge comes in three stages: 
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Familarisation and exploration. Each group is given a set of user
stories. Time is given for them to read these and do some initial CRC
scoping. All four group members work together.
</LI>
<P>
<LI>Implementation. One pair implements and one observes, with pairs
swapping at regular intervals. Implementation is not only of the system
but also of the unit tests and end-to-end tests. Observing pairs will
be reflecting on the actions of the implementers and planning future
actions. 
</LI>
<P>
<LI>Modification. A number of new user stories are introduced. Groups
have to make as many modifications as possible in a short time.
Modifications will be designed to ensure refactoring is the key.
</LI>
</OL>
<P>
A project for the coding challenge will be of a scope similar to the
following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Contact manager: holds names, addresses, appointments. Extensions
include: optional fields or free-form notes, appointment alarms, to do
list.
</LI>
<LI>Resource assignment: usual teachers, qualifications, rooms problem.
Extensions include: optimisation of resource allocation, new types of
resource or qualification, what if scenarios.
</LI>
<LI>Version control system: checks (virtual) files in and out.
Extensions include: permissions on file check in/out, simple config
maps, reporting.
</LI>
<LI>Order routing: an order object is accepted by a system which determines 
whether to automatically accept, divert or block the order depending on the 
customer. Extensions include: testing on other properties of the order, 
discounts
configurable for selected customers.
</LI>
