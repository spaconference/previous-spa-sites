  Little more than a year old, XML seems to be the next technology of the
web. XML is of great importance because it can enable a multitude of IS
functions: data warehousing; meta-data definition (and so allowing
disparate applications to be integrated); general 3 or N-tier web-based
application architectures; and document management and workflow.

XML appears at first simply to be a data definition language -- the
complete antithesis to the object approach of binding data and behaviour
-- but in practise it complements objects very well. XML has the
potential to organise data into abstract types which are easily movable
between components and can be associated with clearly defined objects.
<P>
The relative youth of the technology can be seen in many forms: XML's
potential rests on some standards yet to be finalised, such as the
language by which the contents of XML documents are defined. Conversely,
many vendors are releasing early–access software that will parse XML
documents.
<P>
Through a series of (short) presentations and exercises, this workshop
will provide participants with the opportunity to explore this nascent technology.

<H3>Objectives</H3>
 By the end of this session, participants will have:
<UL>
<LI>       familiarised themselves with a subset of XML syntax,
<LI>       defined their own XML document using a DTD,
<LI>       identified the advantages and disadvantages of alternative document
description languages, and
<LI>       compared alternative mechanisms for processing XML data.
</UL>

<B>Audience:</B> A prototypical participant will have heard of XML, possibly
have read the specification. (In addition we assume that the participant
is familiar with object–oriented design or programming.)

<P>
At the start of the workshop I'll provide an overview of the technology, its current state and how the different technology focus areas listed above plan to make use of it. Then, working in small groups, we will design one of a selection of sample problem applications (drawn from the types listed above) and document their application models using both object and XML technology.
