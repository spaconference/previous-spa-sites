Object-Oriented lanaguages have failed to deliver the wholesale re-use that
once they promised.  Few have managed to achieve significant success above
the implementation of class libraries.  Why?  The answer generally cited:
"it's too damn difficult".  Delivering re-use across projects at the object
level is hard.  It requires the wholesale use of common infrastructure
capabilities, this infrastructure provides the bed upon which developers
can lay their own applications, assured that they will be able to
interoperate with others.  Re-use is now defined at a much coarser level of
granularity than the object, now its defined the component level (although
lets not be fooled , O-O languages and principles are of course the
underpinnings of the component).
<P>
This talk aims to take a look at what it takes to build and deliver
enterprise components, highlighting the role of CORBA, Enterprise Java
Beans and DCOM, but focusing on the issue of middle-tier persistence and
the role of Versant in solving this problem.
<P>
Component development requires a re-think of the role of the database, no
longer is the database king, and for complex components existing database
technologies don't offer the capabilities to handle complex data and
complex data relationships in a performant manner.  Components need a
reliable, highly performant middle-tier persistence mechanism to support
the business processing being performed there.  Versant as a proven ODBMS
demonstrably provides the capability to build highly scalable, performant
components that are unconstrained by the limitations of older technologies.
 But middle-tier persistence cannot exist in a vacuum, it must be possible
to coexist with exiting operational data and database solutions.  To this
end Versant's universal data access capability aims to deliver a unified
object view of operational data to the middle-tier, managing the mapping to
and from the middle-tier and the operational systems as an administrative
function.
<P>
By the end of this talk you will hopefully have gained an insight into the
role of components and importantly the need to re-think the role played by
a database in the middle-tier, as Albert Einstein once said:
<blockquote>
                        "YOU DON'T SOLVE PROBLEMS
        WITH THE SAME KIND OF THINKING THAT CREATED THEM"
