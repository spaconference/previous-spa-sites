Hour-long sessions that present a topic, with some opportunity to 

try them out and plenty of discussion time.

Longer sessions that provide a substantial time to explore an issue.

<P>Some workshops are extended tutorials, in which the session leader

sets goals and provides examples. Others are exploratory groups, organised

in such a way as to exchange experience and ideas between the participants.

A BOF is a session set up by any conference participant, on any topic

of interest. It could be three people meeting in the bar, or fifty people

in a structured workshop.

<P>You might set up a BOF about something you want to find out about;

<P>This is widely judged to be one of the most effective sessions at

the OT conferences. 

There is time allocated to BOFs on each day of the programme.

<P>The conference organisers will provide all assistance and advice 

required to run a BOF (especially on techniques for handling big ones).

<TD VALIGN=TOP COLSPAN=2><B>The Object Technology conference has a tradition of active

participation. We encourage conference sessions that bring people together

to work and learn ñ in most cases, sessions are highly interactive, involving

participants and session leaders on an equal footing. The types of session

that typically make up the programme are described here, although if you

are proposing a session and want to do something different, we always welcome

new suggestions.</B></TD>

Workshops are sessions in which participants work in a structured

way on a topic set by the workshop organiser. At the end of the workshop,

the participants, in conjunction with the workshop organiser, would normally

produce and make available to other participants some conclusions and,

ideally, suggestions for avenues worthy of further investigation.</B> 

<P><B>Workshops may take many different forms and submitters are free to

propose their own structure and process. It is very important that proposals

are explicit about the process that will be followed. </B></P>

<TD><B>A tutorial consists of a presentation on a clearly focussed topic

which is aimed at a defined category of software professional. For example

a tutorial could be aimed at experienced project managers, or at professionals

actively working on object-oriented design projects. You should have a

clear idea of what insights your participants will take away, and why they

will find these interesting.</B> 

<P><B>While tutorials are expected to contain a certain amount of formal

lecturing, you should try to incorporate a degree of interaction between

participants, for example by including a quiz or questionnaire. </B></P>

<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP><B>A working group is formed to conduct a detailed

exploration of some aspect of object technology, to identify how that aspect

of the technology can be advanced, and then to put in motion the work needed

to achieve this advance. Working groups are run to encourage the exchange

of ideas between object technology practitioners with the aim of generating

or encouraging progress that is applicable to the software community at

large. A leader of a working group may require some pre-conference input

from participants (submission of a position paper or preparation of a pattern

for review, for example).</B> 

<P><B>Formal working group sessions take place on the afternoon of Sunday

28 March 1999, before the main conference. Groups may continue to meet during

and after the conference. </B></P>

<TD><B>A goldfish bowl provides an effective means of exploring the breadth

of opinion on a given topic. The session is started by a small discussion

group (say four or five people) consisting of specially invited participants,

with the rest of the participants forming an audience. Spare places in

the discussion group are available, and members of the audience may take

up these places when they feel they have a contribution to make. Members

of the discussion group leave their places when they have had their say,

making room for new participants.</B> 

<P><B>The session should produce documentary output of the conclusions

reached, typically in the form of a poster.</B></P>

<TD><B>A think-tank session consists of a small group of people meeting

to solve a particular problem or to find an agreed position on some issue.

Think-tank sessions are intensive, focused and produce concrete output

in the form of a poster for other conference participants.</B>

for any materials that may be needed, and for ensuring that the poster

is produced. </B></P>

experiences and lessons learnt in implementing object technology. Discussion

of failures as well as successes is welcome. The experiences described

can be drawn from any aspect of object technology projects.</B> 



<P><B>Useful topics to address in a case study session would be:

background to why object technology was used; report on the experience

of using object technology; what went wrong and why; what went well

and why; what lessons have been learnt from the experience.</B>

Unlike the longer, more in-depth conference sessions, Soapbox sessions

are an opportunity to give a quick-and-dirty presentation about

something - anything - in the world of software development that

interests, excites, puzzles, or worries you.  A soapbox session is 15

minutes long - 10 minutes for presentation and 5 minutes for

questions.  Four soapbox sessions will be grouped together in a single

75-minute time-slot and there will be a moderator to ensure that

everyone gets a chance to speak and be questioned.



<P> A submission for a soapbox session should consist of

a brief outline of the subject you are going to address, some

indication of the session style (possibilities include: OHP slide

presentation (3 slides maximum), product demonstration

(non-commercial), poster presentation, demolition of a commonly-held

position, or exposition of an unfamiliar one.
