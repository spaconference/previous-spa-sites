<FONT FACE="Times">Translation is the generic term for the (typically
automated but at least tightly defined) conversion of analysis
work products through design to code.  Translation is set to be
one of the hot topics for the next decade.  During a recent public
debate between translation proponent Stephen Mellor and translation
opponent Grady Booch at OOPSLA 96, Booch was obliged to accept
the reality of translation.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">What are the benefits of translation?  What
is wrong with elaboration anyway?  Why has translation not been
possible before?  What role do objects play in translation?  Do
patterns fit into the picture?  Are there any down-sides to translation?
 How do I get started?  This workshop will answer these, and other,
questions.  It identifies and reports on the maturity features
needed for a method to support automated translation.<BR>
