<FONT FACE="Times">Most of the attention relating to distributed
object systems these last few years has been focused on middleware
adhering to the COBRA specification.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">However, if a development requiring processing
on multiple platforms can be implemented using only one language,
alternative and essentially simpler approaches are available.
 This workshop provides an opportunity for hands-on experience
of using IBM Distributed Smalltalk, Java RMI, and one of a number
of other frameworks that are becoming available (for example,
Caltech's Java-based InfoSpheres.  A simple distributed object
system will be implemented, with the intention of exploring basic
techniques and implementation issues, comparing systems, and presenting
the findings to participants.<BR>
