<FONT FACE="Times">There are people and teams who build excellent
solutions - small or large, local or distributed, one-off or product-line.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">An important recent direction in application
development is to accept that we can learn from, and build on,
this excellence. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">One increasingly popular way to capture this
learning is with Design Patterns, prototypical and reusable segments
of solutions. Another way is through pattern languages, networks
of small specific solution patterns, where the generality comes
from choosing patterns for the current problem context.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">Although there are some published pattern languages,
in general details are not made public, as they are often specific
to the context of the work, and also because they represent valuable
intellectual property.<BR>
