<FONT FACE="Times">Do you ever get the impression that object-oriented
methods offer little direction and rely too much on the intuition
and expertise of the developer team?  Have you experienced failure
in applying a so-called 'method', only to find that it was merely
a set of notations?  Do you need a directed approach to developing
object-oriented software that has the same strength as SSADM for
traditional software?<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">The Discovery method is designed to overcome
these difficulties. In Discovery, activities and techniques are
selected and sequenced according to their ability to involve the
client, focus the mind of the developer, provide visual feedback,
facilitate discovery and invention of objects, and support systematic
cross-checking.  The method asks questions like:  Why was this
technique developed? What aspect does it accentuate?  How does
it direct our attention?  What can we measure, evaluate, and cross-check?
 How can we incorporate patterns, frameworks, and libraries? 
It provides an object-oriented process that can be applied immediately
to medium-sized projects.  Discovery is UML and OPEN compliant.

<FONT FACE="Times">This session shows how to use the method to
sequence and link particular techniques chosen for their effectiveness
in focusing the mind of the developer-team on the next development
stage.<BR>
