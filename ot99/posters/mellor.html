<FONT FACE="Times">People do not want methods. They want solutions.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">Software system construction today is treated
as a craft.  Time-to-market requirements, the sheer volume of
software to be written, and the need for better quality spell
the end of the days of designers as artisans.  Systems have to
be engineered in very different ways. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">This keynote session explores a world in which
software construction is automated to a large degree;  where software
is an asset not an expense;  and where creativity is focused on
problem abstraction. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">In this world, software engineers will take
on three roles - analyst, architect, and toolsmith - and methods
will focus on how to build factories that make software, rather
than writing software 'by hand'. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">The session outlines the basic technologies
that go together to support plug-and-play software: rigorous notations,
automated processes, translation, and software-platform independent
descriptions of architecture.  This technology remains a dream
to many practitioners, but the technology to support this vision
is here and maturing.<BR>

is best known for his contribution to the development of object-oriented
analysis and the Shlaer-Mellor Method.  He is currently Senior
Vice President of Project Technology, Inc., where he serves as
co-researcher, with Sally Shlaer, for Project Technology's extensions
and applications of the Shlaer-Mellor Method.  Mr Mellor and Ms
Shlaer are currently working on their third book <I>Shlaer-Mellor
Method: recursive design</I>.  Mr Mellor is also a member of the
editorial board for IEEE Software.<BR>
