<FONT FACE="Times">In his book and TV series <I>How buildings
learn</I>, Steward Brand examines how buildings are changed and
developed after they are built.  He identifies different paths
of change and proposes that buildings adapt best when their design
is considered in layers.  He suggests that time creates the greatest
buildings, but only if their architecture allows them to learn.

<FONT FACE="Times">There are many lessons to be learned here,
not just by architects of buildings, but by architects of software.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">This workshop investigates the parallels between
architecture in buildings and in software and, by drawing analogies
from Brand's work, looks at how we might design software that
learns well.<BR>
