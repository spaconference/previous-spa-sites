<FONT FACE="Times">This session presents a case study involving
a large-scale distributed system development by a team experienced
in such developments and aware of many of the more widely-published
design patterns.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">The session maps the usage of design patterns
from printed page to deployed system.  It also examines the lessons
that can be learnt from these experiences, and what actual benefits
can be expected from using design patterns in such an environment.

has fifteen years' experience in IT development largely in the
development of distributed systems, including the design and implementation
of IBM's OS/2 LAN Server and CICS on AIX products.  David's experience
spans programming and design of distributed systems using tools
such as Open Group DCE through to distributed object technology
analysis, design, and implementation.  Over the last two years,
David has been working for the ECsoft Group as technical architect
on a number of distributed object technology projects providing
enterprise-class commercial systems for the financial services,
retail, and leisure industries.<BR>
