The Java Beans Object Model</H1></CENTER>

<CENTER>Wednesday 8 April 10:15-13:15</CENTER>

Introduction</H2>
Java Beans is the object model for Java. It provides a standard API that
can be used for defining reusable software components that can be manipulated
visually or programmatically by other software, including builder tools
and code generators.

<P>All Java objects can be introspected by the Introspection API to determine
their properties: attributes, produces events and consumed events. Attributes
are determined by the presence of <I>getX()</I> and <I>setX()</I> methods,
produced events by the presence of methods that register <I>Listeners</I>and
consumed events by determing which <I>Event Listener</I> interfaces are
implemented.

<P>Any class can be a Bean, as are all of the classes in the JDK1.1, by
following the standards defined for the APIs. In addition though, objects
that have not been wriiten to these, standards can also be made into Beans
by the addition of <I>BeansInfo </I>and, if required, specialised <I>Property
Editor</I> classes.
<H2>
Who Should Attend?</H2>
The workshop will be relevant to Java developers of any level of experience.
Previous knowledge of Java Beans is not assumed. If you have experience
of other component and object models (such as COM/ActiveX) you will find
it useful to compare the features of Java Beans.
<H2>
Workshop Structure</H2>
This workshop will cover:
<UL>
<LI>
Java Beans basics:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
The Java Beans object model and the role of Introspection</LI>

<LI>
Event handling</LI>

<LI>
Bound Properties</LI>

<LI>
Property Editors</LI>

<LI>
JAR Files</LI>
</UL>
&nbsp;
<LI>
Advanced Java Beans:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
Activation Framework</LI>

<LI>
InfoBus</LI>

<LI>

</UL>
</UL>
Presentations of key aspects of the API will describe Java Bean's features
and explain the thinking behind the component object model. These will
alternate with individual and group exercises where example beans will
be created for use in various scenarios.
