<H1>Personal Cybernetics: learning from experience</H1>
<H3>Steve Freeman, OTI</H3>

  Every software professional makes mistakes, but we lack mechanisms to
  share those mistakes and learn from them. This session attempts to
  address this by requiring each participant to describe a significant
  mistake they have made in their career. This mistake need not be
  technical, but we would like to understand the situation in which it
  happened and what it tells us about real software development. One
  essential point, however, is the papers that blame everything on higher
  management, even if justified, will not be accepted; we are here
  to learn from our own mistakes. The session will then try to distil
  some software facts of life from these experiences.

<H3>Principal objectives</H3>
  The purpose of the session is to share difficult experiences and
  some understanding of how to cope with or, better, avoid them.

<H3>Intended audience, level of experience</H3>
  Attendees should be experienced software professionals who have
  experienced at least one difficult project and who will admit to
  being fallible.

  <B>Every participant must submit a one page note describing a failing
  experience from their own career.</B> These will be distributed to all
  participants at the start of the session. The notes may be handed
  in during the previous day at the conference but we would much
  prefer early submission, <A HREF="mailto:steve_freeman@oti.com">electronic if possible</A>, to help us plan
  the session.

<H3>Deliverables</H3>
  One person will act as a scribe for the session and, together with
  any interested participants, produce a poster and, possibly, a
  paper.
