<FONT FACE="Times">This session represents an architecture overview
of Union Bank of Switzerland's global treasury backoffice system.
 The system has been developed in Smalltalk and uses GemStone
as its object-oriented database system.  The system receives deals
from the frontoffice and carries out typical backoffice processing,
such as booking, paying, and confirmation of deals, matching incoming
confirmation, and enabling backoffice staff to validate and change
deal contracts.  The goal of the project is to replace a suite
of backoffice systems with a customisable system that can be installed
in many trading branches of the bank.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">Key issues addressed in the project are increasing
automation and reducing maintenance cost.  The volume of transactions
is expected to increase to 20,000 deals a day, each deal having
a complex data structure of many objects and references to other
bank data in existing relational databases.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">Object-oriented development started in February
1995 with a first version of the application running in production
since September 1995.  This first version used ObjectStore as
the object-oriented database system.  Development work is distributed
between teams in Zurich and London.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">The case study discusses the real-life experiences
of the project and the lessons learned in implementing a large,
scaleable, workflow-based business application using object technology.
