<FONT FACE="Times">Tom DeMarco has suggested that 'you can't control
what you can't measure'.  In object-oriented systems it is not
always that easy to know what to measure but object-oriented projects
still have to be controlled.  This tutorial summarises the material
discussed and developed in the working group of the same name
(being held on Sunday 5 April), which examines the relationship
between the object-oriented development process and software measurement.

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">It is all too common for research in this area
to consider metrics in isolation from the process within which
measurement is made.  From an industrial viewpoint measurement
often appears as an academic topic unrelated to the problems and
requirements of software production in the real world.  Metrics
such as those from Chidamber &amp; Kemerer have been proposed
in theory and used in practice, but never in a really convincing
fashion.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">Academia and industry need to collaborate to
produce sound measurement research that is transferred into industrial
practice.<BR>
