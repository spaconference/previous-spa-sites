<FONT FACE="Times">There is a growing consensus that the unit
of reuse in software development is not the single object but
is the component, a group of objects working together to provide
a service.  The principal type of relationship between components
in a model of a system is that of dependency;  and a component
that is dependent on too many others, or on others that are inappropriate
in some way, has low reusability.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">This session demonstrates the utility of open
interfaces, abstractions that permit components to be made less
dependent (and hence more reusable).  Open interfaces help the
architect or designer to apply Meyer's open-closed principle to
full effect, achieving more adaptable solutions.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">The session offers a systematic view from the
architect's perspective, showing how complex systems can be made
adaptable by improving the reusability of their component parts.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">Participants will gain an enhanced understanding
of the usefulness of component-based modelling, and will possess
a simple technique for improving component reusability and de
coupling large systems.<BR>
