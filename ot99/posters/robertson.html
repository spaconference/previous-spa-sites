<FONT FACE="Times">Object-oriented architectures and modelling
methods are good at developing structural models for business
applications.  However it is in the area of modelling the dynamic
behaviour of systems where complexity enters the notation of typical
object-oriented analysis methods. For example in modelling methods
such as Syntropy or UML, the type diagrams are relatively straight
forward and can be used to expose a domain model to end users.
 However this cannot be said of the state diagrams, and related
concepts such as events and guards, which are typically used by
such methods to model dynamic behaviour.  Problems occur when
trying to combine such methods within an architectural framework
for the definition and execution of business processing.  This
session describes recent experiences in this area.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">The case study concerns the design of a large-scale
financial application for the capital markets.  The architecture
developed has introduced a framework for the modelling of business
processes in a distributed object-oriented environment.  The framework
developed not only provides a model for the definition of business
processes, but also drives the actual execution of the corresponding
processes.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">The framework developed is designed to be used
both as a development tool by Cumulus and as a configuration tool
by the end-user in order to configure the system to meet the business
requirements of the client organisation.  The architecture also
enables the corresponding business processes to be exposed to
the end-user.  The model must therefore necessarily be deliberately
oriented at its target audience.  Specifically it must not require
a great deal of 'programming' or 'systems analytical' expertise.
 This has been the primary design consideration when developing
this framework.<BR>
