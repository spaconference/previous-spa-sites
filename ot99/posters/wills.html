<FONT FACE="Times">Component-based design (CBD) may be seen as
two activities:  building products by assembling components; 
and designing components.  There are different emphases of robustness
and rigour in the two modes.  In product assembly, we rely on
robustness in the carefully-crafted components;  in component-building,
there is more emphasis on investment in future reusability.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">When building products from disparate components,
it is important to start from clear models of what is required
and the components available.  The models can be used to clarify
how the components are coupled together, and how a collection
of components will meet the requirements.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">In general, the models will all start from
different views of the business concepts:  for example, an accounts
subsystem, a sales support component, and a dispatching support
will all have their own views of what a customer is.  These differing
views need to be reconciled in order to plug the components together.
 This process reveals gaps and inconsistencies for which 'glue'
has to be written.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">A kit of components designed to work together
needs a consistent architecture: that is, a set of rules and protocols
about how components in the kit are intercoupled, and the concepts
they and representations they share in common.  This architectural definition
is one of
the most reused set of ideas in such a kit, and must be worked
out and documented carefully.  Again, appropriate modelling techniques
are very valuable.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">This workshop examines some of the ways in
which modelling techniques can be applied to improve the effectiveness
of CBD.
