<FONT FACE="Times">Object performance engineering makes predictions
of real life performance behaviour of object models.  Most approaches
so far rely on simulation tools or on the ad hoc solution of performance
problems once an object model goes into production.  This tutorial
explains how analytic models can be developed using large scale
multi-class performance models<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">In this approach, every class in the object
models is treated as a performance class, and all triggers are
used to find the network structure of the performance model. 
When volume (quantitative) information on the object model is
given (like number of objects in the classes, event or message
throughput numbers, or even probabilities for events or messages)
it is possible to develop performance bounds as well as performance
estimates for the object model performance.  In particular, performance
bottlenecks in the model can be detected early in the development
process, and alternative models to avoid the performance problems
can be developed.  Moreover, turnaround time estimates for messages
or events can be obtained, which gives insight into the performance
of a workflow.  Finally the performance impact of growth of object
models can be forecast.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">Object performance engineering is an emerging
discipline that may contribute significantly to the understanding
of performance aspects of object models, and to discussions on
performance of object technology.  In a way, object performance
engineering is an extension of software performance engineering
techniques for object technology.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">The techniques discussed in the tutorial do
not depend on any particular object methodology.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">The session provides participants with insight
into possibilities for predicting the performance of an object
model.  By means of the examples and exercises, the relevance
of performance engineering is demonstrated.  Participants will
be stimulated to learn more about performance modelling as applied
to object technology.<BR>

is professor of Business Information Systems in the Faculty of
Economics and Applied Economics at the Katholieke Universiteit
Leuven (KU Leuven).  He is also director of the University ICT-center
LUDIT and director of ELiAS, a spin-off company of KU Leuven which
operates in the field of library automation.  Guido Dedene was
active in GUIDE and SHARE Europe between 1987 and 1997.  His main
research areas are formal methods for object-oriented analysis
and design (including research on the MERODE methodology) and
quantitative management techniques for information systems (including
performance analysis).  This tutorial results from a blending
of these research domains.<BR>
