<FONT FACE="Times">For two years, we have been conducting a project
to collate and disseminate in a homogeneous, easily-accessible
format, successful approaches and techniques for teaching and
learning object technology.  The purpose of the project has been
warmly greeted by a wide audience at a variety of conferences,
and we have been encouraged to continue.  One of the major issues
we encounter repeatedly is how best to format and categorise the
ideas so that they can be easily understood and reused.  We initially
chose a pattern format, and have found this to be a useful tool
for formalising ideas into a homogeneous structure.  Currently
we are formulating the patterns already collected into a pattern
language, and have been grappling with questions of decomposition
and categorisation.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">Depending on the initial perspective of the
learner or educator, there may be more than one appropriate structure,
language, categorisation.  For example, an educator may start
from a position of having teaching materials which need to be
re-used in a different setting, or they may start from a specific
set of course goals.  A learner of object technology may need
help in understanding a specific concept, or in understanding
the differences and similarities between two issues.  An appropriate
patter language (or appropriate pattern languages) should be able
to support these (and other) aims.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">This workshop explores alternatives and tests
them out against example teaching and learning scenarios such
as those given above, or scenarios which participants have encountered
in their own experiences.<BR>

<FONT FACE="Times">  What should a pattern language to support
the teaching and learning of object technology look like?<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">  How should it be structured to promote accessibility
and therefore use?<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">  Are there a number of equally appropriate
languages?<BR>

was one of those responsible for designing and developing a masters
level distance education course in object technology for software
professionals.  The course was first presented in November 1994
and takes on average over 400 students a year. She has chaired
and tutored the presentation of the course for two years. Through
the course she is investigating how experienced software developers
are best able to be supported while they make the shift from the
traditional to the object-oriented approach. Within the pedagogical
patterns project she has co-led workshops at ECOOP 96, TOOLS USA
96, OOOPSLA 96 and Object Technology 97.<BR>

has been a member of the Computer Science Department at the University
of North Carolina at Asheville since 1981.  In addition to teaching
object technology courses to university students, she researches
issues in education and retraining procedure-oriented students
and industry developers in the object technology paradigm.<BR>

undertook to introduce object-orientation into the teaching of
Staffordshire University starting in 1990.  In 1992 he designed
and delivered the University's first course in object-oriented
programming using Digitalk Smalltalk, and then expanded provision
to courses in object-oriented analysis and design for various
degree awards.  During 1995 and 1996, he taught students at masters
level in Hong Kong and provided consultancy to several UK companies.
 He recently joined The Bloomsbury Software Company.<BR>
