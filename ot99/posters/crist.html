<FONT FACE="Times">At a birds-of-a-feather session during last
year's Object Technology conference, experiences of using object
request brokers were elicited.  The results of this discussion
were not promising for proponents of ORB technology:  only a handful
of participants believed that the technology was mature enough
to support large distributed applications in business, and these
with reservations. This session provides a follow-up to last year's
discussion in the form of a structured forum for participants
to explain and discuss their use of ORBs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">The session addresses the choice, introduction,
use, and management of ORB technology, with participants sharing
their experience of addressing these issues.  The session will
provide an assessment of the maturity of ORB technology.<BR>

<H2>
Who should attend?</H2>
Anyone using ORB technology to implement distributed object systems, evaluating
ORB products or considering their use.
<H2>
Objectives</H2>

<UL>
<LI>
Present an opportunity for asking and answering questions surrounding the
choice, introduction, use and management of ORB technology</LI>

<LI>
Share experience of addressing these issues</LI>

<LI>
Provide an indication of the perceived maturity of ORB technology</LI>
</UL>

<H2>
Structure of the session</H2>
The session will be run as a goldfish-bowl with wizards. These wizards
are invited contributors (maximum 4) with particularly strong experience
or views: their role is to initiate and provoke the discussion.

<P>Participants at the session will be required to write down at least
one question each on a form provided, and will be asked to add any answers
either as they arise or at the end of the session. The completed sheets
will serve as a measure of the effectiveness of the session (was your question
asked? was it answered?) and will be collected at the end to form part
of the session output

<P>An introduction will present the rules of play. During the session normal
goldfish-bowl rules will apply (the wizard's have a wild-card which allows
them to eject a participant from the table if they need to). A non-participating
helper will act as scribe to record salient points in the discussion. The
session will be rounded up with summaries from the wizards and presenters,
completion of the question/answer forms, reflection on the process and
a vote on the session's leading question.
<H2>
Output</H2>
As part of the session process, participants will record their own principal
questions and note answers which arise. These will be collected and summarised
for presentation on a poster, along with any other significant findings,
and will be written up for publication.
