<FONT FACE="Times">As object-orientation becomes one of the major
mainstream technologies in use, increasingly OT projects are being
asked to reengineer existing non-object-oriented systems.  Many
projects have tried the approach of deducing the functionality
of the existing system and attempting to build a new system starting
from scratch.  Only a very small proportion have succeeded.  Instead
a more promising approach is to use the existing code as a basis
for the new development.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">This working group explores the possibility
of this approach.<BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">  How can we reengineer existing non-object-oriented
code into an object-oriented system to retain its functionality
yet improve its structure? <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">  How can we use component technologies to
wrap existing non-object-oriented technology?<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">  What are the implications on object-oriented
design and architecture of building on existing non-object-oriented
code?<BR>
</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times">To apply for participation in this working
group, please contact the session convenor Charles Weir at &lt;cweir@cix.compulink.co.uk&gt;.
 Participants in the session are encouraged to submit a position
paper beforehand.  While this is not a condition of participation,
it will assist the convenor in selecting participants.<BR>

has more than ten years' experience of working on software development
projects and has been using object-oriented techniques for more
than six years.  As a consultant with Object Designers, and as
an independent, he has provided on-site mentoring to many companies
in several countries.  In each company he has worked with teams
and individual developers to facilitate the introduction of object-oriented
skills and techniques.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">Charles has also been responsible for writing
and presenting courses in C++ and object-oriented design.  He
has also designed and presented workshops in object-oriented techniques,
particularly concentrating on the theoretical and practical issues
of using such techniques in practical projects.<BR>
