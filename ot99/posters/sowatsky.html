<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Java Beans</H1>

<CENTER><P>Wednesday 8 April 10:15-13:15 Nathan Sowatskey - Ambra Data
Systems &nbsp; </P></CENTER>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>Java Beans is the component object model for Java. It provides developers
with the means for creating reusable software components that can be manipulated
visually or programmatically by other software, including builder tools
and code generators. </P>

<P>Java objects can be introspected by the Introspection API to determine
their properties, attributes, produced events and consumed events. Attributes
are determined by the presence of <I>getX()</I> and <I>setX()</I> methods,
produced events by the presence of methods that register <I>Listeners </I>and
consumed events by determining which <I>Event Listener</I> interfaces are
implemented. </P>

<P>Any class can be a Bean by implementing the APIs as described in the
Java Beans specification. In addition, objects that have not been written
to these standards can also be used as Beans if user defined <I>BeansInfo
</I>classes are provided. </P>

<H2>Who Should Attend?</H2>

<P>The workshop will be relevant to Java developers of any level of experience.
Previous knowledge of Java Beans is not assumed. If you have experience
of other component and object models or (such as COM/ActiveX) you will
find it useful to compare the features of Java Beans. </P>
