<FONT FACE="Times">This case study involves the use of an object-oriented
framework, FLEX, as the basis for development of systems for one
of the world's largest trading exchanges.  The framework encapsulates
functionality as business objects, which are implemented in Eiffel,
and are distributed using the DAIS Object Request Broker.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">The session illustrate how a variety of technologies
and design ideas have been brought together to address the goals
of flexibility and scalability.  It examines the way in which
ORBs are used in large-scale systems, and offers views on business
objects, dynamic typing, design patterns, Eiffel, and the development
process.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">The session is aimed at those with an interest
in applying object technology to the development of large-scale
distributed systems.  Although the business domain is Exchange
Trading, the technologies and design ideas are of wide applicability:
 participants do not need knowledge of the financial sector. 
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">Particular emphasis is placed on the design
alternatives, the choices made, and the reasons underlying those
choices.  Input from the audience will be encouraged as the alternatives
are discussed.<BR>

<FONT FACE="Times">  Large-scale design:  how to subdivide a system;
 business objects;  how to build one;  components and classes;
 how to store one;  function versus data;  dynamic typing and
type-objects<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">  Distribution:  getting the granularity right;
 interface objects;  to ORB or not to ORB? <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">  Class design and language:  why Eiffel; 
design patterns applied or discovered;  using assertions<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">  Methodology:  the development process;  libraries
versus systems versus applications;  what is reusable?<BR>
