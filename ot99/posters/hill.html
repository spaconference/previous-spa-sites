<FONT FACE="Times">Collaboration is one of the latest buzzwords
in the software industry, but what does it really mean?   Too
often used as a synonym for co-ordination (assigning meeting times,
collecting and distributing notes, engaging in on-line discussions,
and so on), real collaboration should be a much richer activity.
 Objects are touted as the common language that will bring together
all the stakeholders in software development:  business users,
analysts, developers, and managers.  This may be true, but what
is needed to bring the technology and its multiple participants
together successfully is a closer look at collaboration techniques
and technologies to complement the objects.<BR>

<FONT FACE="Times">Today's software development is a team effort
that requires experts in domain, user interface, programming,
management, testing, communication, reuse, training, and deployment.
 With projects and systems so large that individual team members
have a difficult time comprehending their entirety, what chance
do these individuals have of successfully working together?  A
new batch of tools are emerging to exploit internet/intranet technology
and claim to take computer-aided collaboration to its next logical
step.  But do they really?  Do we really understand the human
barriers to collaboration to such an extent that tools and processes
can be developed to directly overcome these barriers?  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">This workshop examines the factors that empower
and inhibit the development team through the different stages
of the software development lifecycle, and proposes techniques
and tools to facilitate successful collaboration.<BR>
