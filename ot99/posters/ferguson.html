<FONT FACE="Times">A multitude of business pressures are driving
enterprises to reengineer their business processes and develop
new systems using distributed object-oriented programming models
and technology.  This session describes the results and trends
that have observed working with many large enterprises over the
past four years, and explains the pressures that drive them towards
the use of object technology.  Most, if not all, of these enterprises
are developing a similar enterprise infrastructure and application
model for deployment of their new object-oriented applications.
 The session describes the important requirements and resulting
architecture components, and explores significant patterns in
the architecture.<BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">Most early customer and software vendor projects
have sadly had to focus on the production of application development
tools and the run-time 'middleware' needed to support the business
objects they wish to develop.  This session uses IBM's Component
Broker as an example of a set of tools and run-time subsystems
that enable greater focus on business logic and application development
through use of vendor-supplied middleware and supporting application
development tools.  The session identifies the critically required
functions and capabilities (such as workload management, integration
with legacy applications, transactions, security, and queries)
and explains how these can be provided in an OMG/CORBA-based environment.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">The session also discusses the next set of
major challenges that need to be met by object-technology middleware
providers to continue the trend towards enabling programmers to
specify what their application should do and develop only the
necessary business logic.<BR>
