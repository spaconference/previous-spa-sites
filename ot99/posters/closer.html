likely to be brim-full with new information that requires careful
consideration and arrangement.  This session is to help participants
round off and complete their time at Object Technology 98.  Participants
will meet in their Home Groups to review their experiences and
their learning, and to make plans for carrying this learning into
their working lives.<BR>

be interaction between the Home Groups to discuss results with
