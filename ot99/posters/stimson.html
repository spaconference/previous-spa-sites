<FONT FACE="Times">Object Technology has gained undisputed centre-stage
in the avant-garde of software development.  The challenge that
it now faces is to achieve the pre-eminence it deserves in the
mainstream of application development.  This means, amongst other
things, the achievement of consistent and repeatable success in
using object technology for the development of large enterprise-class
information systems and mission-critical transaction processing
systems.<BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">This tutorial defines a road-map for object
technology's successful migration from the avant-garde of software
development to the mainstream.  It maps the challenges object
technology faces and suggests strategies for successfully overcoming
these challenges.<BR>

has thirteen years' experience in IT development. This experience
has spanned programming, design, analysis, and methodology development
in real-time and business systems.  he has used both traditional
structured development methods and object technology for enterprise-class
distributed system development.  Most recently he has been active
in ECsoft as chief analyst, technical co-ordinator, and methodologist
on a number of large object technology projects.  These include
the Bass Taverns Ulysses Central Retailing Systems (CRS) project
which won the OMG/IBM award for 'best use of object technology
within an enterprise or large systems environment' and the Comdex
UK 'Object technology application of the year' award. <BR>
