<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE>CORBA 3.0 is adding new technologies such as Objects by Value,
Asynchronous Method Invocation (AMI), Time-Independent Invocation (TII),
and Components. Each of these new features alone is enough to require
tremendous changes to the internals of most ORB systems. Taken together,
however, they require that ORB providers rethink the architectures and
designs of their ORBs to ensure that all of these new features work
together seamlessly for application developers. This talk will explain each
of these new features and how they influence both the ORB itself and your
applications that depend on it. The talk is targeted at CORBA application
developers who want to have a better understanding of how new technologies
influence the architectures, designs, and implementations of both their own
applications and of the ORB systems they're built on.

</TD><TD width=75%>Steve Vinoski is Chief Architect for IONA Technologies. A frequent speaker
at technical conferences, he has been
giving CORBA tutorials around the globe since 1993. Steve has also helped
put together several important OMG specifications, including CORBA 1.2,
2.0, and 2.3, the OMG IDL C++ Language Mapping, the ORB Portability
Specification, and the Objects By Value Specification. In 1996 he served on
the OMG Architecture Board. He is currently the chair of the OMG IDL C++
Mapping Revision Task Force. Together with Dr. Douglas C. Schmidt, he
writes the "Object Interconnections" column for the SIGS C++ Report
magazine, and he is currently writing "Advanced CORBA Programming With C++"
with Michi Henning, to be published by Addison Wesley Longman in 1998.
