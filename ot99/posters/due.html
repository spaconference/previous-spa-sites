<FONT FACE="Times">This session explores a systems development
approach that allows end users, analysts, and designers to independently
develop integrated systems.  The use of Proxy and Broker patterns
are proposed in a new approach to the project management and architecture
of object technology application systems.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">The tutorial also investigates the use of these
patterns with the 'software piranha' and 'duck' design philosophies.
 The software piranha philosophy uses event-driven design to stimulate
the behaviours and responsibilities of independent objects.  The
duck philosophy places all interpretation of behaviour into separate
observing objects.  The goal is the elimination of the 'miracles'
that are required to transform analysis to design and design to
code in traditional software engineering approaches. <BR>
</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times">Ed Yourdon calls 'The end of the age of miracles;
approach 'novel and intriguing', but wonders how it will fare
in the market-place over the next few years.  The prime objective
of this session is to critique and enhance the approach.<BR>
