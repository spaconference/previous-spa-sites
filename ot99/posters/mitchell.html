<H1>Patterns: what, why, and how</H1>
<H2>Richard Mitchell and Franco Civello<br>
University of Brighton</h2>
A 75-minute tutorial on patterns.
<HR>
<h2>Who's it for?</h2>
The tutorial is aimed at people who have heard the noise about 

object-oriented design patterns (such as those in the book by Gamma et al) but who have not yet looked at individual patterns, or how they might be used in a particular design.

<hr>

<H2>What's the point of patterns?</H2>

Here's a picture (followed by the 100 words it's worth). 
<br><br><IMG SRC="mitchell1.gif">  <br>
<p>
Software design often involves trade-offs. For example, you could design a piece of software
so that it was really easy to build, but quite hard to extend to meet future requirements. Or, you could use more 
sophisticated techniques that made it harder to build, but easier to extend thereafter.
<p>
Sometimes, it is possible to lessen the effect of this kind of trade-off by doing some work at a <strong>strategic level</strong>. Here are some examples:
<ul>
<li>build a user interface using a GUI-builder</li>
<li>build a workflow system using a workflow language</li>
<li>build a DP system using SQL</li>
<li>build any program using design patterns.</li>
</ul>
<p>
 The diagram illustrates the last example.
 
<hr>
<h2>How will the tutorial work?</h2>

We'll take you through the design of parts of a drawing editor,
asking you to think about the design choices along the way,
and to make suggestions for improvements.

<P>Then we'll show how using well-understood patterns makes the
design quicker and 
easier to do, and easier to discuss with colleagues.

<P>For the examples, we'll use UML class diagrams and some C++/Java-style code.

<p>
<p>
<hr>
<h2>Key topics</h2>

We'll cover:
<ul>
<li>The idea of a pattern
<li>Three specific patterns
<ul>
<li>Template pattern
<li>Factory method pattern
<li>Strategy pattern
</ul>
<li>How common software mechanisms can be implemented in common code
<li>How algorithms can usefully be turned into objects
</ul>

<hr>
<H2> What will you go away with?</h2>
You'll be given 
<ul>
<li>a small catalogue of patterns</li>
<li>screen shots of the editor at work</li>
<li>outlines of designs that use patterns</li>
<li>a short list of sources of more information.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Less tangibly, we hope you'll go away feeling confident to start exploring the literature of patterns, and to start thinking about where to use them in your own work.
</ul>
