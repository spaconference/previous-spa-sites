<FONT FACE="Times">Popular approaches to object modelling, such
as UML, use sequence  and activity diagrams to model the dynamics
of systems.  It is evident that a similar approach could be applied
to modelling business processes in order to gain a better understanding
of requirements and improve those same processes.  However, the
semantics of the UML sequence diagrams and the underlying metamodel
of objects is quite inadequate for this purpose.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">This tutorial shows how this situation is remedied
by the  stronger semantics of SOMA, wherein sequence diagrams
do support branching, rendezvous, and concurrency and where activity
diagrams (use cases) are generated automatically leading to testable,
executable specifications.  The arguments are illustrated using
a case study based on a large modelling project.<BR>
