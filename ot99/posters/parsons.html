<P>WS1 Workshop Monday 1400-1700 </P>

<H1>UML: What, Why, How?</H1>

<H2><A HREF="../people/dparsons-card.html">David Parsons</A>, Southampton
Institute </H2>

<P>This workshop explores the key aspects of the Unified Modelling Language
version 1.1. It addresses the questions: </P>

<UL>
<LI>What is the Unified Modeling Language? </LI>

<LI>Why has it been developed and why should I want to use it? </LI>

<LI>How do I draw the diagrams and how do they relate to the design process?
</LI>
</UL>

<P>In this workshop, the notation and philosophy of the UML is contrasted
with previous object-oriented design notations, particularly those that
it supersedes (OMT, Booch, OOSE). Simple design exercises are used to introduce
notation elements, and participants will be invited to share their own
experiences of design notations and their responses to the UML. </P>

<P>The objective of this workshop is to introduce the UML notation and
to encourage a critical discussion regarding the potential roles of different
design processes, given that the UML itself is intended purely as a notation.
The session will also enable participants to apply the UML to simple design
problems using a range of processes. </P>

<H3>Key topics</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Development of the UML </LI>

<LI>UML diagrams and features </LI>

<LI>UML class diagram notation </LI>

<LI>UML use case diagram notation </LI>

<LI>Types of interaction diagram </LI>

<LI>Available processes and their relationship to the UML </LI>

<LI>Conclusions: pros and cons of the UML </LI>
</UL>

<H3>UML Resources:</H3>

<P>The main UML site is provided by <A HREF="http://www.rational.com/uml">Rational
Corporation</A> , where the 'three amigos' who wrote the UML (Rumbaugh,
Booch and Jacobson) work </P>

<P>Among the many materials you can download are some sample chapters from
'UML Distilled', by Martin Fowler and Kendal Scott, a good introductory
text. You can get this material (in a roundabout way - there's no direct
URL) from the Addison-Wesley website - just type 'UML' into the quick search
text box on the <A HREF="http://heg-school.aw.com/cseng">Addison-Wesley
Computing and Engineering page</A> where you will also find references
to other UML titles. </P>
