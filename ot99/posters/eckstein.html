<FONT FACE="Times">Discussions at conferences (for example, the
Educators' Symposium at OOPSLA) have shown that we still feel
it is difficult to teach object technology.  This is true wherever
the education takes place:  it is hard to teach object technology
in industry and in academia.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">It is commonly believed that teaching object
technology is hard because the students have to make a paradigm
shift.  This is true, especially when the students have already
been educated in structural thinking and programming.  But it
is only half the truth.  If the people dealing with analysis,
design, and programming have to make a paradigm shift to learn
object technology, it should also be necessary for the educators
to make the paradigm shift in teaching object technology.  The
way structural thinking has been taught does not work for teaching
object technology.  We need to change the way we teach.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">Picking up object technology is difficult for
students because the educators still have not made the paradigm
shift.<BR>
