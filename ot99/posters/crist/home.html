Is ORB technology ready for the big time?</H1></CENTER>

<CENTER>
<H2>
Goldfish-bowl session: Monday 7th April, 14:00</H2></CENTER>

<CENTER><A HREF="/ot98/people/ccrist-card.html">Colin Crist</A></CENTER>


<P>At a BOF in OT97, experiences of using Object Request Brokers were elicited.
The results of this discussion were not promising for proponents of ORB
technology: only a handful of participants believed that the technology
was mature enough to support large distributed applications in business,
and these with reservations. As a follow-up to that session, this goldfish-bowl
will provide a more structured forum for participants to discuss their
use of ORBs.
<H2>
Who should attend?</H2>
Anyone using ORB technology to implement distributed object systems, evaluating
ORB products or considering their use.
<H2>
Objectives</H2>

<UL>
<LI>
Present an opportunity for asking and answering questions surrounding the
choice, introduction, use and management of ORB technology</LI>

<LI>
Share experience of addressing these issues</LI>

<LI>
Provide an indication of the perceived maturity of ORB technology</LI>
</UL>

<H2>
Structure of the session</H2>
The session will be run as a goldfish-bowl with wizards. These wizards
are invited contributors (maximum 4) with particularly strong experience
or views: their role is to initiate and provoke the discussion.

<P>Participants at the session will be required to write down at least
one question each on a form provided, and will be asked to add any answers
either as they arise or at the end of the session. The completed sheets
will serve as a measure of the effectiveness of the session (was your question
asked? was it answered?) and will be collected at the end to form part
of the session output

<P>An introduction will present the rules of play. During the session normal
goldfish-bowl rules will apply (the wizard's have a wild-card which allows
them to eject a participant from the table if they need to). A non-participating
helper will act as scribe to record salient points in the discussion. The
session will be rounded up with summaries from the wizards and presenters,
completion of the question/answer forms, reflection on the process and
a vote on the session's leading question.
<H2>
Output</H2>
As part of the session process, participants will record their own principal
questions and note answers which arise. These will be collected and summarised
for presentation on a poster, along with any other significant findings,
and will be written up for publication.
