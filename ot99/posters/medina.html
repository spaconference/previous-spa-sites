<P>Despite the unparalleled growth in use of the internet that has taken 
place over the last three years, internet technology has some 
shortcomings in terms of meeting today's demands for business 
functionality.  This case study shows how a business internet-based 
application can be developed using object technology and a Java-based 
middle-tier.  The result is robust and flexible applications capable 
of meeting the challenges of future changes in technology and business 
requirements.
<P>
This session compares alternative solutions in terms of investment, 
flexibility, performance, portability, scalability, interoperability, 
and resilience.  It also discusses gains that can be obtained in terms 
of cost, rapid application development, and rapid application 
delivery.
<P>
This case study demonstrates that object technology (including CORBA) 
applied to internet solutions has the potential to provide 
industrial-strength applications at lower cost and risk, increased 
flexibility (applications can be developed over intranet, extranet, 
and internet), and with faster development and delivery.
