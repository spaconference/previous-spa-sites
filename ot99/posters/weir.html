<FONT FACE="Times">This tutorial teaches participants how to document
a software architecture.  A software architecture consists of
all the decisions about how the system will satisfy its non-functional
requirements:  performance, scaling, distribution, and fault-
tolerance.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">Charles Weir draws on experience designing
several large object-oriented systems to produce a format to help
people write a software architecture document.  In this session,
he explains what the documentation needs to contain, and what
is a sensible structure for it.  The tutorial is illustrated with
experiences from particular software projects.<BR>

has more than ten years' experience of working on software development
projects and has been using object-oriented techniques for more
than six years.  As a consultant with Object Designers, and as
an independent, he has provided on-site mentoring to many companies
in several countries.  In each company he has worked with teams
and individual developers to facilitate the introduction of object-oriented
skills and techniques.<BR>

<FONT FACE="Times">Charles has also been responsible for writing
and presenting courses in C++ and object-oriented design.  He
has also designed and presented workshops in object-oriented techniques,
particularly concentrating on the theoretical and practical issues
of using such techniques in practical projects.<BR>
