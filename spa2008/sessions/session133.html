	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">The use of Domain Specific Languages has become increasingly popular in recent times, with an aim of bringing the language in which we develop software closer to the language that our customers use when they talk about the business domain, and making code easier to read and clearer in intention.<br />
<br />
There has been a good deal of activity recently, particularly in the Ruby community, in using dynamic languages to produce “embedded” or “internal” DSLs. Producing a similar effect in languages such as Java can appear more difficult.<br />
<br />
In this hands-on session, developers will write their own embedded DSLs in Java, using techniques that we have learned from the design and evolution of embedded DSLs in projects such as LiFT, Hamcrest and jMock. We will collectively review the DSLs and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of writing embedded DSLs in Java. These techniques should be applicable to other Java-like languages, such as C#.<br />

Prerequisites: Attendees should bring a laptop with their preferred Java development environment installed. We will be working in pairs, so if you don’t have a laptop you should be able to pair up with somebody who does.<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Materials provided:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">We will give attendees some existing code and tests and then get them to refactor towards an embedded DSL. We’re aware that time might be an issue so we will try to structure the exercise and introduction to give attendees enough hints that they can make some progress.</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Initial presentation of ideas and techniques (20 mins) <br />
Attendees will work in pairs on laptops to develop an embedded DSL (60 mins) - we aim to provide two scenarios so that there is some variety amongst the group. Skeleton code and tests will be provided to get people started. <br />
Swap pairs around and get experience of using an embedded DSL that somebody else has developed (30 mins) <br />
In original pairs, discuss/refactor language based on feedback (20 mins) <br />

Comments from the XPDay7 reviews for this session: <br />
<br />
"I'd definitely attend this session. I think that we have a number of good examples of embedded DSLs out there now, but there hasn’t been much guidance about how to write them. Anything you can present in the way of patterns or stories about blind alleys in design would really help, I think." - Michael Feathers<br />
<br />
"That sounds great." - Nat Pryce</td></tr>
