	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Architects use the Architectural Description (AD) to communicate the structure and key features of their architectures to a range of stakeholders - not only the developers who will build it, but also to the sponsor, to users, to operations and support staff, and to many others. However each of these has very different interests in the architecture, different levels of technical expertise and understanding, and different amounts of time available to read it.<br />
<br />
Producing a set of Architectural Description documents which effectively gets the right messages over the the right people, and which stays current during the life of the project, is daunting task for any architect, from the beginner to the most experienced. Faced with a blank sheet of paper, and a lot of sometimes contradictory guidance on views, models, and other architectural deliverables, it is difficult to know where to start, and where best to focus your (often limited) time and effort.<br />
<br />
The objective of this workshop is to share best practice on effective techniques for documenting architectures and ensuring that the architect's key messages are communicated to stakeholders. We will use the experience of the presenters and the attendees to explore: what content you can and should include in your AD; what you can safely miss out; how to get your key messages across most effectively; and what tools and techniques work best.<br />
<br />
We also plan to use what we discover as a basis for producing a generic architectural description template, which we will make available to conference attendees.</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Benefits of participating:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">If you are an architect who has to produce an Architectural Description then this session will help you answer the following questions:<br />
- What level of detail should I include in my AD?<br />
- Where is the dividing line between the AD and requirements? the AD and design?<br />
- How do I recognise a concern as being architecturally significant and therefore worthy of discussion in my AD?<br />
- What techniques can I use to get my messages across succinctly and strongly?<br />
- What sorts of documentation should I produce?<br />
- How long should my AD be? How do I stop it becoming too wordy and cluttered but still provide the required level of detail?<br />
- How much audit trail should I include (decisions, rationale, alternatives rejected)?<br />
- What documentation tools should I use?<br />
- What works?</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">We will start with a short introduction to set the scene - explain what the Architectural Description is and why it is important, explain the concept of stakeholders, and review the types of stakeholder and their different interests in the AD.<br />
<br />
The first workshop will focus on what should and can go into the AD. Clearly this includes architectural views, models and other means of representing the architecture itself, but may also include other content  such as: scope definition; current context; requirements overview; alternatives considered and rejected; principles with rationale and objectives; glossary of terms etc. We'll review what sort of content should be included in what circumstances, and what can or should be left out. (For example, including alternatives which you considered and rejected can confuse your readers, and can also stir up controversy which you want to avoid.)<br />
<br />
To speed up the process, we will start the group off with a longlist of AD contents. We will encourage the workshop participants to consider the issue of "architectural significance" - that is, how to decide whether something is important enough to require documenting in the AD, or can be safely left to the design and development stage.<br />
<br />
The second workshop will look at tools and techniques. Teams will pick their "top 3" types of AD content from the first workshop, and explore how they can be documented to capture an appropriate level of detail and communicate the right messages to the readership. While architectural tool support is still very limited, we will encourage the audience to share their experiences, good and bad, in using tools to help automate the production and ongoing maintenance of these types of content.<br />
<br />
We will finish with a short discussion around "socialising" the AD - that is, making your stakeholders aware of its existence, helping them understand the content, and reinforcing what's important about the architecture.</td></tr>
