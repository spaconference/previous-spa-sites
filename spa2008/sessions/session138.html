	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">The aim of this session is to explore costs and impact adding diagnosability to software systems to handle configuration, user error, system error or software bugs.  <br />
<br />
As software has become both more complicated and distributed the ability for a simple error message to help diagnose an problem is limited.  The technical aspects of reporting errors are well known and even with all these in place it is not always enough.  Sometimes it takes a concerted effort to reproduce a running environment and debug into the code to find what a problem is.  Even during development it can be difficult and costly to find the cause of a problem, especially during integration or system testing.<br />
<br />
Questions this session would seek to answer are:<br />
<br />
- What are the defining features of a diagnosable system rather than one that just reports errors?  <br />
<br />
- What does it take to make software diagnosable?  What is worth diagnosing, what is not?<br />
<br />
- When should diagnosibility be considered, during development, when issues arise?<br />
<br />
- What is the impact on the life-cycle costs, does it cost more to develop, does it make end-to-end testing a more efficient process, does it make deployment simpler, does it reduce the overall cost of the software?<br />
<br />
- What is the impact on customers of the software, in particular does this help any of the customer roles more than others?<br />
<br />
- At the end of the day is diagnosibility worth the extra effort rather than a simpler error message approach?<br />
<br />

It is expected that there will be flexibility in the schedule as more questions are raised and discussed.  It is expected that the attendance will be relatively modest to allow the group to work as one, however a larger audience will be handled splitting the audience into groups.<br />
<br />
00:00-00:05 A brief introduction<br />
<br />
00:05-00:20 What is diagnosibility?<br />
<br />
The aim of this segment is for the group to agree what diagnosibility means, what makes it different from error handling, how it is might be implemented.<br />
<br />
00:20-00:35 What are the benefits?<br />
<br />
The aim of this segment is to find the positive impacts based on the definition agreed in the first segment. Whom does it benefit? Developers, Testers, Customers, Operators?  It is good for all problems?  What costs does it reduce?<br />
<br />
00:35-00:50 What are the costs?<br />
<br />
The aim of this segment is to find the negative impacts. What does it make harder?  Who is least helped? What costs does it increase?<br />
<br />
00:50-00:75 Is it worth it?<br />
<br />
This segment is provided to consider diagnosability in cost/benefit terms with the groundwork already performed in the previous segments.  The aim is to answer the question: "is it worth it?"  and to provide the reasoning for the answer.  This will form the basis of the output of the session.<br />
