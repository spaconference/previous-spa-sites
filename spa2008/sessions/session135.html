Being on projects with rubbish project management I saw the large effect that project managers can have, and wondered how they could get it so wrong - it doesn't look like it should be rocket surgery.<br />
<br />
I thought I might be able to do better so became a project manager. Almost immediately my decision to go into project management was met by a mixture of incredulity and sympathy by developers I had worked with. I was met by some hostility and almost derision by developers I hadn't worked with.<br />
<br />
What should project managers do? What do they actually do? Does it matter if they appear rubbish to developers as long as they do their job, whatever that is? Why are developers so hostile to project managers? Why do they think they can do a better job but then avoid ever doing it? Do you need a project manager at all?</td></tr>
