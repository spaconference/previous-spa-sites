	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Knowledge of how to do good software development is plentiful.  There are books full of methodologies, studies, patterns, etc. etc.  Developers are constantly learning and project retrospectives generate more knowledge on how to do things better.<br />
<br />
But we find it hard to do what we know.<br />
We are not alone, there is a whole book on the subject ‘Knowing Doing Gap’ by Pfiffer and Sutton.<br />
<br />
Agile methods highlight this problem: developers want to work Agile, managers want the benefits so why is the world full of people who don’t do it?<br />
<br />
In this session we want participants to focus on the ‘knowing doing gap.’  Understand what it is, why it exists and how we can close it.<br />
</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Audience background:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Anyone who has ever been frustrated failing to do what they know is for the best.  Developers who want their teams to change and Managers faced with changing/improving their organizations.<br />
</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Benefits of participating:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Participants will understand the knowing doing gap, what it is and why it exists.  They learn techniques for closing the gap and helping their teams act on their knowledge and learning.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Materials provided:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">An initial presentation (probably using slides) of the gap and important concepts.<br />
<br />
We propose to use ‘Dialogue Sheets.’  These are a technique developed by the Royal Institute of Technology (Sweden).  These are large (typically A0) sheets used to promote and direct discussion.  We will design our own dialogue sheets in advance.<br />
</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Each team will be asked to complete a dialogue sheet.  This is made up of three parts, arranged as concentric circles:<br />
1.	Outer circle: Thought provoking comments, quotes and phrases<br />
2.	Middle circle: Questions and directions for the team to discuss (8)<br />
3.	Inner circle: Recommendations from the team (and space for comments)<br />
<br />
Teams are directed to follow the directions and answer the questions.  Finally they are asked to make 3 recommendations.<br />
In the last part of the workshop each team will be asked to give a brief overview of their sheet and their recommendations.  Other teams will be able to ask questions.<br />
<br />
There will be a vote on each teams recommendations so one team can be declared The Winner.<br />

Dialogue sheets will be available for other conference attendees to view.  As such they will act like posters but the commonality will make them comparable.<br />
<br />
Sheets will be photographed and made available electronically as PDF files and the conference wiki.<br />

Lise Hvatum and Allan Kelly have previously run workshop sessions together at EuroPLoP 2005 (‘What do we think of Conways Law now?’) and EuroPLoP 2006 (‘Socio-Economic forces effecting a major software architecture’).</td></tr>
