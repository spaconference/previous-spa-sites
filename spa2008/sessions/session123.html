	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">As we continue to evolve our software development methodologies and embrace agile techniques, isn't it time we did the same for our choice of programming languages?  Languages such as Python and Ruby continue to gain ground as tools for rapid prototyping or the speedy development of robust, fully-fledged business applications, particularly in the fast-moving domain of web-based systems.  This tutorial will explore how you can make the most of these powerful tools.<br />
<br />
The session will be a fast-paced, hands-on introduction to the very latest version of the Python programming language (version 2.6, to be released in Spring 2008), with a special emphasis on developing web-based systems.  Along the way, we will explore some of the interesting recent developments in the world of Python - such as Microsoft's IronPython, an implementation of the language using the .NET Framework.<br />
<br />
Python has gained significant traction as a very effective tool for developing database-driven web applications, YouTube being a prominent recent example.  Participants will gain direct practical experience of this approach to web application development, via an exercise using one of the latest and most highly regarded Python web development frameworks, Django.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Audience background:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Participants should be proficient in at least one modern object-oriented programming language such as Java or C++.  Prior experience of Python or other very high-level languages is not required.  Some familiarity with building database-driven web applications is desirable, but by no means essential.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Benefits of participating:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Participants with no prior experience of very high-level languages will gain a very useful and productivity-boosting 'second string to their bow'.<br />
<br />
Participants with some knowledge of Python or other very high-level languages will benefit from learning about the latest features of the language, and how it interfaces with the Java and .NET platforms.<br />
<br />
Those with an interest in web application development will get a very practical introduction to the use of modern web frameworks.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Materials provided:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">CD-ROM containing slides, details of practical exercises and software (including Python 2.6 itself, the Django framework and various other useful tools).</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">The session will consist of short, lecture-style segments, punctuated by Q&A and short practical exercises.  There will be a longer period of practical work near the end, where participants will build a web application using Python and Django.  There will be the opportunity to work on this final exercise collaboratively.<br />
<br />
Participants will need to bring with them a laptop of some sort (Windows, Linux or Mac OS X).<br />
