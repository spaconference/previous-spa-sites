<br />
The co-presenters of this simulation have many years of hard earnt experience in systems integration and in this session we hope to teach what we have found out the hard way, using role play and situation simulation. We also expect to learn from the novel solutions that SPA session participants always seem to be capable of creating!<br />
<br />
The structure of the session will provide attendees with the opportunity to explore and contrast the "just do it" and "centrally planned" styles of integration through a small but realistic simulation exercise.</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Audience background:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Ideally, participants will either have worked in, or be about to embark upon, a systems integration project, however it is likely to be of interest to anyone involved in large scale systems development.<br />
<br />
Knowledge of applicable processes, techniques and technology is preferred but not necessary. The more knowledge that attendees bring to the session, the richer the learning experience for all, but anyone with creative thoughts or questions about the integration area are welcome!<br />
<br />
Participants should bring a laptop with wireless networking if possible, but we don't need everyone to have one so this isn't a requirement.</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Benefits of participating:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Understand the dynamics of integration projects and how they affect the solutions that can be applied to integration problems, including:<br />
<br />
- Technology trade-offs such as the ease of semantic representation versus on the wire speed<br />
- The effect of geographical separation on inter-team communication and how this affects the integration approaches that can be used<br />
- Negotiation techniques for agreement on data standards for messaging<br />

- A set of simple, but non-trivial, message-based interfaces for the systems along with sample messages to illustrate their use<br />
- An XML schema designed to represent a proposed standard model for the exchange of data (that may or may not be complete)<br />
- A set of defined choices for the technical architectures and implementation<br />
- A set of team roles and role playing situations intended to simulate various working environments</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">The simulation architecture will consist of 2 'front office' applications which are required to send similar data to two different 'back-end' services.<br />
<br />
The simulation will require that teams working in distributed sites must communicate their design  without direct face-to-face contact (this will require the use of the wireless network).<br />
<br />
The attendees will be organised into three groups of four or more people.  These groups will then be split into two pairs (or subgroups): the front office team and the back office team.<br />
<br />
The front office teams will all work in one area, the back office teams in another (we were thinking of the "sofa room" and the bar area at the Robinson Centre).<br />
<br />
Each group is given a defined process to follow in order to attempt to integrate their systems.  The three processes are:<br />
1) A free for all 'JFDI' approach where each FO developer talks to both BO developer directly and just integrates as they see fit (within the requirements) but they cannot meet face to face (they'll have to use MSN Messenger, GMail or similar via the wireless Internet connection)<br />
2) A centrally orchestrated approach where the existing XML 'standard' model schema must used as a brokered interface.  Again, these teams can't meet and must have any discussion needed via electronic means.<br />
3) A 'design by committee' approach to data standardisation that has to identify a suitable standard approach to the integration and the use it to integrate the systems.  These teams can meet, but only to discuss approach, they have to return to their rooms to do the work.<br />
<br />
The actual "coding" of the integration will be to produce integration "maps" that define the field level linkages between the systems.  We'll probably capture these as tables on paper or in a spreadsheet to avoid the complexities of setting up development environments and getting compilers and libraries working.<br />
