	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">In a large application development for a leading UK insurance provider, it was becoming difficult to recover the 'big picture' from a large number of use cases expressed against an evolving domain model.<br />
<br />
This case study covers the adaptation of storyboarding to show the internal working of the system, rather than the screen flow. The resulting storyboard shows how interactive data capture, internal processing, and interaction with external systems combine to build up and use a complex domain model, in the course of an end-to-end business scenario.<br />
<br />
While in principle the storyboard could be based on UML object diagrams, such diagrams would be very big. Techniques used to achieve more concise and digestible diagrams included spatial containment, meaningful layout in two dimensions, stacking, and folding away unnecessary detail.<br />
<br />
Reactions to the storyboard have been very positive - people from programme managers to testers have found it understandable and useful. A typical comment: the storyboard "brought the system to life".<br />
<br />
I have more recently begun using similar techniques in another project, again with good reactions.<br />
<br />
The session has two objectives: to communicate the ideas and experience achieved so far, and to engage the audience in reviewing and improving the approach.</td></tr>

Say what the reaction has been, recap on the principles, and give some advice on the process of developing a storyboard.<br />
Open up discussion of other ways of achieving similar results, pros and cons of my chosen approach, and how to improve on it.<br />
I'll conclude by showing a couple of samples from my other project, and asking for final comments and suggested next steps.</td></tr>
