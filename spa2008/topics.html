    <h1>Session Topics</h1>
<p>We are looking for interesting, engaging sessions on any topic related to improving software development practice.&nbsp; The list below provides some suggestions for possible session topics, but this isn't an exhaustive list, so proposals for sessions on other relevant topics are very welcome too.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Agile Development</strong> - are you an agile development practitioner?&nbsp; Have you new ideas that could push the agile field forwards?&nbsp; Or perhaps experiences that others could learn from?&nbsp; Run an agile development related session to share your knowledge and find out what others know too.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Case Studies</strong> - as an industry, we're not short of optimism about new technologies and approaches, but we do seem to be very short of shared experience as to which really work and why. Have you applied a technology, a development process or an approach to software development that worked or didn't work? If so, why not run a session that shares the experience so that others can benefit from it?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Emerging Technologies</strong> - new technologies appear all the time, some become successful mainstream standards, some are successful in niches, while others fade away.&nbsp; If you're working with an exciting new technology, or perhaps involved in creating one, then why not run a session to tell people about it?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Evolving Systems</strong> - successful systems never stand still, but are always expected to change, often in unexpected ways. How do you deal with change in your systems? Are there approaches or technologies that help with this? If you've worked with systems that needed to change significantly over time, why not run a session that explains how you did it or explores how you might do it differently next time?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Integration </strong>- a constant challenge for most organisations is how to integrate they systems they have, as well as how to build and integrate the new ones that they need.&nbsp; Sessions that explore this difficult area in new and interesting ways are always of interest.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Managing Software Projects</strong> - while design, development, testing and all of the other software specialisations are important, a constant factor in many failed projects is management difficulties.&nbsp; We're keen to see sessions on any aspect of software project management including planning, staffing, team organisation, controlling projects and the human factors that so often make the difference between success and failure.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Metrics and Measurement</strong> - when trying to improve anything, it's important to be able to measure the effect of changes that are being made.&nbsp; Software developers are often criticised for lack of measurement and quantification of the benefits of advances that we try to introduce, so sessions exploring metrics related to all types of software development practice are of interest.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Modelling </strong>- the creation of models has been an important part of software development practice for decades and modelling has been a common topic for sessions at SPA conferences.&nbsp; Sessions could cover any of the types of models used by software developers including behavioural, information, concurrency, performance and security models.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Model Driven Development</strong> - do you use models as a primary development artefact and generate large parts of your system from them?&nbsp; Have you used OMG MDA or a home grown approach for MDD?&nbsp; What languages and tools work and for what?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Novel Architectures</strong> - are you tired of n-tier client server? Have you experience of the alternatives? Have you created P2P or grid systems? Used portable code or agent technology? Perhaps you've used or created something none of us have heard of? Why not run a session to teach others or share experiences of the new sorts of system that you've worked on?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Open Source</strong> - the ideas and actions of the open source community have completely changed how a lot of software is developed, sold and supported, both commercially and within large organisations.&nbsp; Sessions on this topic might share experiences or explain how people can use open source technologies, approaches or ideas in their work.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Requirements </strong>- if the requirements are wrong, then it's difficult to get anything else right, but defining "right" is never easy.&nbsp; Sessions on this topic can explore different aspects of identifying, capturing, validating and meeting requirements in various software development environments.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Software Architecture</strong> - interest in software architecture has grown immensely in recent years and this has been reflected in the programme of recent SPA conferences.&nbsp; Software architecture sessions could discuss methods and techniques, frameworks and tools, the role of the software architect or experiences from applying software architecture on large or small projects.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Software Development Processes</strong> - how do you organise your software development work?&nbsp; Are you a high ceremony CMMI team?&nbsp; Or an ultra-agile XP group?&nbsp; Or like most people somewhere in the middle?&nbsp; Sessions on software development processes can present new ones, critique existing ones or try to design new ones, perhaps via simulations, thinktanks or workshops as well as more traditional tutorials.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>System Qualities</strong> - do you know how to make a system secure, or scalable, or easy to change, or to provide any of those other qualities that often make building systems so difficult?&nbsp; Why not run a session explaining how to do this?&nbsp; Or perhaps one where you work with participants to gather their knowledge as well, in order to produce some solid recommendations?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Testing</strong> - testing is a broad field that provides great potential for interesting sessions at the conference, from tutorials on detailed techniques, through thinktanks on testing and validation subjects, to workshops exploring how best to use testing and validation approaches.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Something Completely Different</strong> - this list isn't comprehensive and SPA programmes have included sessions on topics as diverse as team dynamics, intentional programming, organisational culture, content management systems and load testing tools so don't be afraid to submit something completely different.</li>
</ul>
