		<h2>What is a BOF?</h2>
		"Birds of a Feather" sessions are meetings that you organise at the conference, about topics that you want to discuss.<br />
		<br />
		The OT conference is a great place for knowledge sharing between all participants, not just the session leaders.
		BOF sessions are an important and popular way of doing this.<br />
		<br />
		<h2>How do I set up a BOF?</h2>
		Several slots are available for BOFs on each day of the programme. There will be a noticeboard on which to
		propose BOFs so that interested delegates can sign up. The organisers will assign rooms.<br />
		<br />
		<h2>How do I run a BOF?</h2>
		Any way you like!<br />
		<br />
		If there are just a few participants, have a chat in the bar. If there are more, start by outlining your
		thoughts or questions, and then let others contribute. Begin by clarifying the general topic, and a list
		of areas to deal with.<br />
		<br />
		Some of you will be more familiar with organising meetings than others. If you need any help organising or
		running your BOF, the conference committee will be very happy to help.<br />
		<br />
		<h2>Why would I run a BOF?</h2>
		You might organise and run a BOF if:
		<ul>
			<li>You want to discuss a specific technique, tool, or pattern or technology.</li>
			<li>You want to get some reaction a new idea you have had. </li>
			<li>You're looking for a new job! </li>
			<li>You need help with a project. </li>
		</ul>
