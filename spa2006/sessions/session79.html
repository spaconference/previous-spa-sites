	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">When you listen to an architect describe their work they often use terms like ‘elegance’, ‘balance’ and even ‘beauty’. These terms are often why we become architects in the first place. While almost anyone can behold the beauty of the Parthenon or Falling Water (Frank Lloyd Wright) yet very few can perceive the delicate structure of a well-executed software architecture. Yet in today’s IT environment this is often mistaken as ‘not focusing on the business’ when, in fact, elegance can often save or make an organization large amounts of money. This presentation will draw parallels to other creative activities and give practical advice on developing an appreciation for useful creativity in architecture. In particular we will explore opportunities for architects to increase their abilities in the following areas: <br />
<br />
•	Elegant Abstraction: Creative solutions to complex design challenges.<br />
•	Creative Teams: How we utilize teams to create a master-piece.<br />
•	Raw Materials: Understand and communicate your ‘creative materials’.<br />
•	Realism: When it’s time to stop making it pretty and get it done. <br />
