	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">This workshop is about how to write acceptance tests that are meaningful, focussed, and understandable. On an Agile project, the acceptance test suite is the medium that bridges between the technical and business members of the team to ensure that the right functionality is delivered. The tests must be clear and understandable by both sides, which implies building a common language within the team. <br />
<br />
This was the original motivation of the FIT framework, and our workshop focusses on the communication aspects of writing acceptance tests.<br />
<br />
We are aiming to:<br />
* motivate readable acceptance tests (as specifications)<br />
* show the importance of declarative style testing vs. procedural testing<br />
* provide experience in growing an acceptance test language<br />
* pass on our experience of using FIT for acceptance testing on multiple projects.<br />
<br />
We will not be implementing or running any code during this session.</td></tr>

The Game<br />
<br />
For the game, the attendees will divided into groups (probably of 6). Each group will be given a scenario and will then work together to write some acceptance tests, sketched on paper. One person from each group is chosen as the storyteller and takes the tests to another group for review. The storyteller talks the other group through the tests, showing how they describe the scenario. The storyteller then turns his or her back on the group and listens while they discuss and brutally criticise what they've just heard. The storyteller then takes this discussion back to his or her own group.<br />
<br />
For the second round, the same storyteller presents the revised tests to a different group.<br />
<br />
Experience Report & Discussion<br />
- talk through some real examples of FIT tests, in particular showing how the style and language have evolved.<br />
- answer questions raised by the game and encourage adoption of FIT acceptance testing</td></tr>
