	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">A software group is best measured by its customers' success. Understanding what they really need is critical, but customers are human too which means that they're fallible. Customers can't always tell you what they want because sometimes they don't know themselves, so asking them to rank requirements or write stories might not be the best place to start.<br />
<br />
This workshop presents techniques for working with customers and other stakeholders to help them understand the context and goals of a project or product. We will describe a range of techniques -- such as "Speedboat", "Product Box", "Butterfly Stamping", and "Give 'em a jacuzzi" -- and run two of them as exercises.</td></tr>
