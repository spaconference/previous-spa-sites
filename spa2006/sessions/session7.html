	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Security is a blind spot in application development. It is typically retrofitted by security professionals tweaking the infrastructure. However, as the network continues to penetrate deeper into homes and professional systems alike, and the voracious appetite for application integration punches more and more holes through traditional, network-based defenses, this approach is faltering. Today's applications must be developed with security in mind.<br />
<br />
This session is a simulation of the security requirements gathering phase of a software project for an extremely well-funded startup called Big Wheel Fortunes. They have comissioned a green-field development of a web application that is ostensibly an on-line casino, but, in fact, serves as a money-laundering operation. Participants are not only asked to play the role of members of a project team, but also those of attacker, customer or other stakeholders. It is essential for developers to be able to transport into the mindset of the attacker in particular.<br />
<br />
A money-laundering application has been chosen because it is a poignant and dramatic, if unusual, illustration of traditional security concerns. On many projects, security issues provoke little thought and trigger standard reflexes. This simulation encourages participants to set the latter aside as many of the usual assumptions do not apply in the simulation's context. For example, the attackers are not necessarily the bad guys.</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Audience background:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">The security requirements engineering techniques presented here rely on agile practices such as user story writing and playing the planning game. Although experience with agile development processes is not essential, it is expected that those with such experience will benefit more.<br />
The session is likely to be of greatest interest to those involved in requirements engineering for systems with significant security requirements such as product managers, software architects, project managers and business analysts.</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Benefits of participating:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Learn how to<br />
- think like an attacker<br />
- identify security requirements<br />
- plan and track security requirements in a software project</td></tr>

	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">0-25 min: interactive presentation of the system to be built, including user stories. User stories have been written beforehand by the organizer. They have also been annotated with business value and effort estimates. User stories and their annotations may be changed as a result of insights occuring during the session.<br />
<br />
25 - 100 min: writing abuser stories.<br />
In order to arrive at abuser stories, the assets needing protection and the potential attackers are investigated jointly by all participants (roughly 1/2 hour). The group is then split in pairs to write abuser stories (approx 25 min). A plenary discussion and assessment of the cost of the respective abuser stories follows.<br />
<br />
100 - 125 min: planning game.<br />
In this part, the difficulty of refuting the individual abuser stories is assessed. A planning game is played using annotated abuser stories in addition to the habitual annotated user stories.<br />
<br />
125 - 150 min: evaluation<br />
In how far do abuser stories afford security requirements tracking?</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Outputs:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">the tangible result of the workshop is a set of abuser stories, annotated with a business value assessment, an effort estimation and their dependency on user stories. If there is an interest for publication of these, the organizer can make them available to participants through his web site.</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>History:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">a precursor of this simulation was held at the AgileOpen conference (http://www.agileopen.org) in March 2005.<br />
a more theoretical presentation on the topic will be presented at the SREIS (http://www.sreis.org) workshop at the 13th IEEE Conference on Requirements Engineering (http://www.re05.org) at the end of August 2005.<br />
I will be facilitating this simulation at XPDay Benelux (http://www.xpday.be) in November 2005.</td></tr>
