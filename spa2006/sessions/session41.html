	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Today, business components typically run inside some sort of container, which provides the components with a standard runtime environment and a set of generally useful services.  Containers help to standardise the form of business components and reduce redundancy between them, so helping components to be integrated to form applications.<br />
<br />
J2EE and .NET both provide sophisticated containers for their components, residing within application servers.  However, the complexity and development difficulties that such containers bring with them have recently led to a number of so-called "lightweight" or "inversion of control" (IoC) containers being developed, which allow Java components to be hosted less intrustively and with less development and runtime overhead.<br />
<br />
This session will introduce the idea of application component containers and will answer a number of questions about IoC containers including the services that various containers provide, the benefits of using them and the limitations that they have.<br />
<br />
The content of the session will include:<br />
<br />
- A short history of IOC containers<br />
- An explanation of the Inversion of Control pattern that the containers implement<br />
- A discussion of the different ways to implement IOC (Constructor, setter etc.)<br />
- A discussion of IoC when compared to its main alternative, the Service Locator<br />
- A comparison of lightweight versus heavy containers (such as J2EE)<br />
- An explanation of how such containers make testing simpler, by facilitating the<br />
  use of Mock Objects<br />
- A discussionn of the limits of IOC containers (there is no silver bullet!)<br />
- An introduction to some of the current containers.<br />
<br />
The presentation material will be illustratedby two extensive practical exercises that will allow participants to get to grips with an IoC container implementation.<br />
<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Audience background:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">To benefit most from the session, participants should have developed Java  applications using J2EE containers and/or the service locator pattern. Against this background, the exercises allow participants to understand how IOC containers change the design of an application. Technically, participants should be proficient in Java and should bring a laptop with them to the session, ideally with a recent JDK and IDE installed.<br />

- Software, including a number of Java IOC containers<br />
- Exercises with detailed instructions, skeleton files and solutions<br />
<br />
In the first exercise, a sample application will be deployed in an IOC containers. Different groups can use different containers and compare their in the discussion. The second exercise consists of the migration of a sample application to IOC and to compare differences in the design of the application before and after the migration. <br />
