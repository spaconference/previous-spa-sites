	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Test Driven Development and Refactoring are powerful tools in the software development arsenal. With them you can add new code to systems and make existing code more maintainable. However, refactoring code without having tests in place can be hazardous. This tutorial presents a collection of dependency breaking and test writing techniques that can be used to get existing code safely under test for refactoring and enhancement. These techniques can be used in conjunction with Test Driven Development to breathe new life into large existing code bases.<br />
<br />
This will be a hands-on session - There will be three different versions of the exercises: C#, Java (1.42 SDK or higher) and C++. Delegates will need a laptop and a compiler for one of those three languages.  You are also encouraged to bring examples of painfully complex code that you'd like to get under test.   We'll use it for discussion at the end of tutorial.</td></tr>

	<tr><td>1. Michael Feathers<i><br>Object Mentor</i><br /><br />Michael Feathers is a consultant with Object Mentor.  Michael doesn't know when he started developing software, but he knows that he has been developing for pay for at least the last twelve years.  He has been active in the XP community for the past four years, balancing his time between working with, training and coaching various teams around the world.  Prior to joining Object Mentor, Michael designed a proprietary programming language and wrote a compiler for it, he also designed a large multi-platform class library and a framework for instrumentation control.  Publically, Michael developed Cppunit, the initial port of JUnit to C++, and has spoken at several conferences.  He is a member of the ACM and the IEEE and he has acted as the chair for the Codefest event at the last three OOPSLA conferences.  When he isn't engaged with a team, he spends most of this time investigating ways of altering design over time in codebases.</td></tr>
