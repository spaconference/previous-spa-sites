	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">An ongoing activity for many SPA participants is finding and trying out new tools and techniques for themselves. This concerns technical tools,  as well as thinking, process and communication tools. For us, this is one of the main reasons to come to SPA, as there are always sessions on topics we haven't explored yet.<br />
<br />
Instead of spending a Sunday on exploring a specific technique, we would like to invite ourselves and others to bring our favourite tools and techniques, to explain what they are (if necessary) to others, and to explore why they work so well for us (and in which context).<br />
<br />
The objective of this session is to understand better why and in which context certain techniques work (or don't work) for us, and to learn new techniques from others. <br />
<br />
Examples of tools and techniques we have been using ourselves are: value stream mapping, iteration planning, temperature readings, retrospectives, scenario planning, test driven development, systems thinking, blogging, going to the gym, refactoring...</td></tr>

We have experience running open space events (Dutch XP users group and the Agile Open conference) and getting people to talk about what inspires them. We want to draw conversations out of the bar into the conference. Therefore  we prefer to spend plenty of time on sunday in a relaxed setting (we understand there is a conference room with couches this time? :-) ).</td></tr>
