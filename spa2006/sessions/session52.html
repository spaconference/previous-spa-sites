	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Over the years we have all developed a comprehensive portfolio of best practices which will help us avoid the common problems on projects, the techniques include:<br />
•	Collaborative working<br />
•	Risk-Based Prioritisation<br />
•	Visual modelling<br />
•	Iterative working<br />
•	Change control<br />
•	Best practices and use of Tools <br />
•	Clear traceability: Linking scope & features to cost & value<br />
<br />
However, there are still many projects which encounter difficulties or fail, a large number of these failures can be attributed to the application of bad practice in the requirements and architecture activities. When you analyse the causes of failure a number of common pitfalls emerge which can be further developed by looking at the problems, their symptoms and ways to avoid or mitigate them.<br />
<br />
Using experience gleaned from many projects, this session will present an overview of how the techniques apply to the requirements and architecture disciplines and our ideas on how to use the techniques to avoid the pitfalls as a series of anti-patterns. This will lead into an interactive session where the group can discuss whether they agree with the techniques and pitfalls, and also propose new anti-patterns which they have observed on projects.<br />

•	Spot the rot and share experiences with the group on how best practices have been applied to the requirements and architecture disciplines<br />
•	Determine the best way to apply these best practices to avoid common project problems<br />
•	Share problems are commonly encountered by participants and how they were solved<br />
