	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">The advent of broadband and 3G mobile telephony means that almost anyone can technically work from home, but should they? This raises a lot of questions, such as:<br />
* What roles/people/projects are best suited for a distributed workforce? And what aren't?<br />
* Are we seeing the end of the monolithic corporation?<br />
* Does outsourcing accelerate the drive to working from home?<br />
* Are we seeing more loosely coupled software teams that reflect the software architecture of the artefacts that they develop?<br />
* What infrastructure do we need in place to help home-based working?<br />
* And what employment policies would help?<br />
* Are we seeing a return to the days before the industrial revolution when weavers worked from home employed by a merchant (like piece-work)?<br />
<br />
This fishbowl will initially be populated with people who are themselves part of the distributed workforce as well as researchers who are focussed on technologies to support this and management representatives who can represent the pros and cons from a corporate perspective. This session is primarily focused on the topic of employees working from home, rather than loosely-coupled, geographically-distributed independent contractors.<br />
