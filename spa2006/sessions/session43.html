	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">The session will allow participants to explore the pros and cons of one of today's hot topics - the use of offshore developers to deliver software products. The session will be lead by Rob Day (who helped an Indian software house set up an object development centre in Mumbai) and Genny Dixon from e-Skills, the IT sector skills council. e-Skills have in depth knowledge of the skill shortfall facing the UK software industry and are playing a major role in upskilling the UK labour force to address that shortfall.<br />
<br />
A panel of invited participants will seed the session. These will include:<br />
John Brightwell - Euro-soft (outsourcing to Russia) <br />
Ian Soden - LBI-Linkhand (outsourcing to India) <br />
Stephen Hutchinson - independent (victim)<br />
Tom Owens - DSDM white paper author (others invited)<br />
<br />
The DSDM team are considering using the insights gained in preparing the white paper to author a book on the subject.</td></tr>

- managers who have done it and want to share experiences (good and bad)<br />
- managers who need to consider it as an option (perhaps unwillingly)<br />
- developers who have been involved<br />
- developers who have suffered as a consequence</td></tr>

	<tr><td>1. Rob Day<i><br>mwr</i><br /><br />CONTACT PERSON, CASTING DIRECTOR & CO-SCRIPT WRITER

Rob is an experienced trainer/mentor in OO methods and project management with a keen interest in OO estimation metrics. Rob specialises in retrospectives (aka audits, reviews & health )of OO projects. Currently Rob is working with mwr - a company at the forefront of DILP production (DILP = digital interactive learning publication).

Rob is building a database of OO effort metrics - any contributions welcome.


Rob is prepared to sacrifice his serious reputation in the OO community to provide OT delegates with the opportunity to see their work in a humourous light. In addition to being crowned on stage with a pointy-hair wig (1999) and appearing as his alter ego Belinda Binda (2000), Rob has helped co-script all the OT plays with the other OT players. The exploitation of XP techniques to play writing in 2001, 2002 and 2003 has proved very effective.

More recently Rob has lead two sessions with Debbie Lawther focusing on the value of the Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) as an effective technique for kick starting the early stages of software projects.</td></tr>
