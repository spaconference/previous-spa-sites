	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Native XML databases provide a radically different approach to data storage from the well-understood Relational database model.  This workshop explores the solution space through the study of a project in which the session leader is the lead architect.  The project is to provide a knowledge base for a University faculty, combining simple data (staff details, the organsiation structure) with complex structured data (programme and module specifications).  The implementation chosen is the Open Source native XML database eXist (Meyer) using XQuery.  The project is in its early days but has already highlighted a range of technical, administrative and social opportunities and threats to the success of the project. Amongst them: the choice of XML database; data modelling for XML databases; the design of schemes (elements or attributes?); schema versioning; document versioning; document partitioning; document ownership; document editing; eager v lazy integrity checking. No doubt others will have emerged by the time of the workshop.<br />
<br />
The workshop seeks to stand back and reflect on the decisions made in this (to the session leader) unfamiliar design space, and to offer attendees the opportunity to contribute to this analysis, not only of the technical choices which must be made but also of the possibilities which are opened up - for example through the move from a single, unitary organistional model to a pluralist model which accepts the existance of inconsistancy, placing more emphasis on the fidelity of the model than on integrity.</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Benefits of participating:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">XML databases wil be increasingly used in applications but the design spaces is (I think) much less well understood that that for Relational Databases.  The workshop should help to explore this space.</td></tr>

20 - 35 – brainstorming of other issues for exploration across the range of technical, project management and organisational. <br />
<br />
For this stage, an SMS-enabled browser –based whiteboard being developed by the session leader will be used to capture and organise ideas.<br />
<br />
35 - 65 – break into small groups to discuss a specific decison area<br />
65 - 75 - group report back and discussion<br />
