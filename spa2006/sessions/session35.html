	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Complexity is the single biggest obstacle to the successful development of large-scale software systems. (Complexity here is meant in its traditional sense - difficulty of understanding rather than in the technical sense of computational complexity)<br />
<br />
One of the major causes of complexity is the difficulty of managing state within a system. As a result, all major programming paradigms provide some means to facilitate handling state but functional programming - which in its pure form eschews state altogether - is arguably one of the more extreme. Possibly because of this, and the difficulty of applying some of its ideas to state-dependent systems, functional programming has seen only limited use in industry.<br />
<br />
This is a shame because it has much to offer in terms of the war on complexity - large functional programs tend to be much easier to understand.<br />
<br />
Functional Relational Programming is a new approach which attempts to bring the power of pure functional programming together with the benefits of clearly defined and managed state. It is hoped that the ideas will allow the development of large systems that are easier to understand (and hence to maintain) than more traditional stateful approaches.<br />
<br />
The ideas should be applicable in any modern programming language.<br />
<br />
This workshop will explore the issue of complexity in large systems and examine its relationship with the handling of state. We will introduce the core concepts of the Functional Relational Programming approach and give participants the opportunity to experiment with the ideas.<br />

	<tr><td>1. Ben Moseley<i><br>Independent</i><br /><br />In the early 1990s I worked for a number of computer companies including IBM and NeXT as well as doing some custom development for a large London Law firm.

In 1996 I graduated from Cambridge with a degree in Computer Science and then joined SBC Warburg where I worked (in a number of countries) on fixed income trading systems for three years.

Following this I spent a number of years doing internet consultancy for Apple and worked with a number of customers on some large inter and intranet sites before returning to the city.

I am currently working at a large investment bank on large scale global electronic trading systems.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>2. Peter Marks<i><br>Digita</i><br /><br />I have been developing software since childhood. Working mostly as a freelance consultant and developer, in financial information and education domains, I have always focused on agile development, customer responsiveness and creativity. I was a co-founder and Director of Operations at Connextra (http://www.connextra.com), a technology company recognised as leading practitioners of eXtreme Programming. Recently I've been consulting on software development practice and micro-gliding with Ruby on Rails.

I'm most interested in Language Oriented Programming, the Functional paradigm and rich-client platforms. I believe that our current approach to managing state is the route of all evils - well many evils; and I am convinced that Three Languages Are Not Enough (sounds like a BoF to me).

I have attended every OT/SPA conference and was the co-chair of OT98.</td></tr>
