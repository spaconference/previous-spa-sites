	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">The Agile Manifesto states: we have come to value individuals and interactions over processes and tools. Tools and techniques are not enough for running your projects, you need 'people tools' as well. We all know that for instance developers and customers fighting abouth who did what wrong doesn't make our projects finish early, yet it is hard to stop doing it. Especially when the pressure is on. This session provides tools and processes for individuals and interactions, to help you take a step towards peaceful, effective projects.<br />
<br />
The objective of this session is to let participants experience a number of tools that will help them to become more effective through:<br />
<br />
- awareness of how our way of communicating influences others and vice versa<br />
- consciousness of the change processes in self, others and the context so that we can surf the waves of change, rather than drowning in the surf of the waves </td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Benefits of participating:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">After this tutorial, you can:<br />
- lose less time and energy due to fighting<br />
- balance interaction between developers, management and customers<br />
- develop a long-term trust relationship between developers, management and customers<br />
- get your team into a state of flow, where the team delivers more value, while being more relaxed at the same time<br />
- focus on problems - create an atmosphere where underlying problems surface themselves, so appropriate solutions can be devised. </td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Materials provided:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">We'll provide some explanation on a flipchart, and a handout with an explanation of each of the Satir tools used in the workshop, as well as a list of references to appliccable literature.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">This workshop is highly experiential. We use role play, games and discussion so that participants will experience the tools, rather than only hearing about them. The maximum number of participants is 20.<br />
<br />
Timetable<br />
* Introduction (10 min)<br />

* Bringing it together for application (40 min)<br />
   - Temperature reading <br />
   - Tie in with daily life (featuring the Satir change model )<br />
   - Closing</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>History:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">This tutorial is based on Virginia Satir's work. A shorter version has been run at the Agile Open conference, and by the time SPA2006 is, we will have performed runs at XP Day Germany and XP Days Benelux, and European Consultants' Camp. We incrementally and iteratively improve this tutorial, so it is (slightly) different at each conference.</td></tr>
