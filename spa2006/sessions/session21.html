	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">The role of Customer is widely considered to be critical to the success of agile development projects, but who is the customer and what skills must they bring?<br />
<br />
When developing for a small coherent set of users it may be ideal for a user to work closely with the development team representing the users' interests, providing domain knowledge and making quantitative and qualitative judgements. However, even in these circumstances, it can be difficult to find someone that can dedicate the necessary time and has the ability to perform the role well. In situations where the user base is larger or more diverse or even nonexistent, such as in a start-up company scenario, choosing a user or even a group of users as the customer can be impossible. Consolidating requirements, mediating between diverse stakeholders (which in a corporate environment may include users, sponsors, managers and support personnel, or in a software company may include external users, marketing, sales, support and management people), balancing priorities, providing comprehensive domain expertise, generalising features, creating or evaluating designs and defining values are skills that may reasonably be required of the Customer that are very often not skills possessed by users. The role of Customer is often (depending on the domain and the skills of the development team) a specialist role.<br />
<br />
Many projects use business analysts to try to bridge the gap between users and developers, but the traditional business analyst role is quite different to that of Customer in agile projects.<br />
<br />
Software product companies tend to define a role of Product Manager, responsible for taking a product from concept to market. This role historically, at least in concept, is much closer to what is needed in a Customer. <br />
<br />
This think tank, will look at the fit of Product Manager in the Customer role. We will examine the impact this has on other roles and consider what makes a good product manager in both software product and corporate environments. Participants will draw on their experiences of agile development and produce job descriptions for Product Managers<br />

	<tr><td>1. David Harvey<i><br>Sibelius Software</i><br /><br />David Harvey has over fifteen years experience in designing, building and managing the development of software. In April 2004 he took on the role of CTO at Sibelius Software, developers of the world's leading music notation software. Previously he was technical Architect at UBS Investment Bank, and has worked throughout the City of London on advanced middleware libraries and architectures. As a consultant he has helped organisations make effective use of object technology, and has delivered introductory and advanced training courses in C++ and OO design. He has presented sessions at the OT conference and elsewhere on C++, patterns, distributed computing and software architecture, jointly (with Paul Dyson) presented the UK's first workshop on Extreme Programming, and was conference chair for OT99.

	<tr><td>2. Peter Marks<i><br>Digita</i><br /><br />I have been developing software since childhood. Working mostly as a freelance consultant and developer, in financial information and education domains, I have always focused on agile development, customer responsiveness and creativity. I was a co-founder and Director of Operations at Connextra (http://www.connextra.com), a technology company recognised as leading practitioners of eXtreme Programming. Recently I've been consulting on software development practice and micro-gliding with Ruby on Rails.

I'm most interested in Language Oriented Programming, the Functional paradigm and rich-client platforms. I believe that our current approach to managing state is the route of all evils - well many evils; and I am convinced that Three Languages Are Not Enough (sounds like a BoF to me).

I have attended every OT/SPA conference and was the co-chair of OT98.</td></tr>
