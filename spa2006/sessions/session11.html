	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">According to security guru Bruce Schneier, security is all about trade-offs you take with respect to your always limited resources. Today, security is often a problem either when designing a system or-in the worst case-as an after-thought. Only a few experts have knowledge to design good security and we can safely assume that there is no security expert in most development teams. Before Design Patterns OO-design was a similar black art only performed well by experts. We expect Security Patterns to provide such leverage for designing secure systems, because they make discussions easier with the common names for concepts, make security design decisions more conciously, and because they tell the truth about their trade-offs. <br />
<br />
This tutorial introduces the current work on security patterns: <br />
*	Why Security Patterns? <br />
*	What is a Security Patterns?<br />
*	History of Security Patterns<br />
*	Selected Security Patterns examples<br />
*	Community process, forum, and how to get involved<br />
*	Status and outlook - where will Security Patterns go?</td></tr>
