	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Flash ActionScript is the object-oriented language that underpins the development of interactive "movies" for use via web browsers and has emerged as a key tool in the rapid delivery of effective e-Learning solutions.<br />
<br />
The objective of this session is to provide participants with insights into the use of this technology. <br />
<br />
The content will be structured around the following topics:<br />
- the evolution of the language in the context of the need for increased sophistication in the toolset, including use of XML<br />
- the use of UML "lite" as a means of exploiting the language's component development potential in support of the intensely iterative development cycle<br />
- an agile audit (what worked; what didn't; what was missed; and why)<br />
- avoiding our pitfalls<br />
- the Flash community (or how graphic designers became software developers)<br />
- future Flash (where the technology might go following Adobe's acquisition of Macromedia).</td></tr>

Participants will also see how a small organisation has been able to benefit from the application of UML and agile techniques, albeit in a very pragmatic manner. </td></tr>

Rob is an experienced trainer/mentor in OO methods and project management with a keen interest in OO estimation metrics. Rob specialises in retrospectives (aka audits, reviews & health )of OO projects. Currently Rob is working with mwr - a company at the forefront of DILP production (DILP = digital interactive learning publication).

Rob is building a database of OO effort metrics - any contributions welcome.


Rob is prepared to sacrifice his serious reputation in the OO community to provide OT delegates with the opportunity to see their work in a humourous light. In addition to being crowned on stage with a pointy-hair wig (1999) and appearing as his alter ego Belinda Binda (2000), Rob has helped co-script all the OT plays with the other OT players. The exploitation of XP techniques to play writing in 2001, 2002 and 2003 has proved very effective.

More recently Rob has lead two sessions with Debbie Lawther focusing on the value of the Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) as an effective technique for kick starting the early stages of software projects.</td></tr>
