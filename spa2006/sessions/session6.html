	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Conservative Extreme Programming (CXP) has the same values and principles as traditional Extreme Programming (XP) but utilises a different development cycle and a number of different practices.  Because good requirements are a pre-requisite of CXP, as is the use of an embedded tester and test team, it can be utilised for projects that XP may not be suitable for.<br />
<br />
This case study is about how a multi-million dollar, mission critical, integration project at one of Europe&#8217;s largest airlines was delivered using a plethora of tools and techniques, including CXP, with a team of ordinary programmers in a politically super-charged environment.<br />
<br />
The objective is to disseminate knowledge of our approach and life on an interesting project.  The project will not deliver until January 2006, therefore this could be a case study about a dramatic failure!  However, the focus will be on practices that we used and lessons we learnt.<br />

- Learn how tools, such as FitNesse, can be integrated into a methodology to help deliver business value to geographically isolated customers/business analysts.<br />
- How to coach a level 1 team to level 3 performance using intense on-boarding and in-project coaching.<br />
- Understand techniques that can be use to affect change within an organisation.<br />
- A chance to discuss all the gory details of software delivery. <br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">A number of topics will be presented, four in total.   They will cover an introduction into the project under study and the CXP methodology; the business case for CXP, and when best to apply it; CXP practices; and finally, a wrap up that presents the benefits and drawbacks of this approach, and its overall success.<br />
<br />
The presentations will be interspersed with group discussions to enable participants to give opinions, supportive or otherwise, and survey how participants have solved particular problems, such as coaching.<br />
<br />
Timetable (75 minutes):<br />
- Introduction (5 minutes).  Here CXP and the project that is the focus of this study will be introduced.<br />
- Group discussion/survey (10 minutes): The advantage and drawbacks of XP and agile methods. <br />
- The Business Case for CXP(15 minutes).  Here particular goals of an organisation are discussed, with group input, and how CXP can help realise them.  The goals include: developer training, increased efficiency and, of course, high quality, working software.<br />
- 5 minute break/informal questions.<br />
- Group discussion/survey  (10 minutes): Coaching.  What are the best techniques for training team members?<br />
- CXP by example (10 minutes).  Here I will walk through the project, including coaching practices, and explain through examples the different practices of CXP and whether or not they were useful during the project.<br />
- Group discussion/survey: the best techniques for organisational change.<br />
- Wrap up (10 minutes): 'Methodologies don&#8217;t deliver projects, people do, but the methodology helps'.  Here I will explain how much the methodology really contributed to the project success/failure.  Additionally, did we change our parent organisations?  Could we convince them to keep changing during the course of the project? What next?<br />
- Questions/discussion (10 minutes): <br />
