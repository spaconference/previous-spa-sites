	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Modern development platforms provide annotations that can be added to various language elements. (We use the Java term annotation as we feel it describes the concept more precisely than the term attribute which is used on the .NET platform.) The developer community is still exploring the use of annotations but we can identify several distinct usage patterns. We have also learned some lessons and have principles that guide our use of annotations.<br />
<br />
This session will explain different patterns of annotation usage. The key contribution of the session is a detailed discussion of a pattern that we have found during the development of an enterprise application and have used successfully since. We call this pattern Domain Annotations, and the idea is to enhance the domain model with domain specific annotations that can be used for a variety of purposes. This pattern has not played a major role in public debate yet but we have found that it is one of the most powerful usages of annotations. <br />
<br />
We will present several examples from a real world application, and we also plan to use the last third of this session to run a Goldfish Bowl discussion to exchange ideas about the use of annotations with the participants.<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Audience background:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">General software development background, understanding of Java or C#. Experience with .NET attributes and/or Java 5 annotations may be helpful but is not required. This topic is closely related to Domain-Driven Design and as such some knowledge of domain modelling would be beneficial.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Benefits of participating:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">- Overview of the use of annotations and the lessons (good and bad) we've learned so far. This should help attendees to improve their use of annotations and hopefully avoid making mistakes that others have made before.<br />
-  Introduction to the concept of domain annotations. This should give attendees a powerful new tool for domain modelling. This is especially useful for people who are interested in Domain-Driven Design.<br />
- An understanding of how other developers use annotations in their projects (based on Goldfish Bowl discussion).</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">0:00 - 0:05 General introduction, waiting for people to get in, etc.<br />
0:05 - 0:10 Whirlwind tour of annotations on the J2SE and .NET platforms<br />
0:10 - 0:30 Discussion of different types of annotations, lessons learnt, etc.<br />
0:30 - 0:50 Discussion of domain annotations<br />
0:50 - 1:15 Goldfish Bowl discussion involving participants<br />
<br />
The discussions of the annotations will be backed by a few slides, which we will co-present, creating a dialogue. We'll show the sample code in an IDE and will explain how the annotations are used and how they affect the runtime behaviour of the application.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Outputs:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">If there is interest we will maintain a wiki space for further discussion after the session. In any case we will make the presentation slides and, more importantly, the code available on a web page.<br />
<br />
If the Goldfish Bowl discussion yields new usage patterns of annotations we will document these on a web page.<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>History:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">This is a new session. We have used this style of annotations internally for a while but only realised in recent discussions with people like Eric Evans that this constitutes an innovation. We are not planning to hold this session at another conference before SPA 2006.</td></tr>
