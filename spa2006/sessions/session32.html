	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">The development team at Connextra had been using XP since the inception of the company. Pair programming, unit testing, refactoring, continuous integration were all taken very much for granted, and were deeply ingrained in the culture. The technical platform was Java, Linux and open source. The developers all worked the same hours, to enable efficient pair programming.<br />
<br />
However, after being acquired by another small software company, we needed to roll the two development teams together. The other company used more traditional planning methods (waterfall process, writing requirements up front, ad-hoc scheduling), with .NET development languages and Microsoft operating systems. The developers all worked flexitime, and rarely spoke.<br />
<br />
The challenge was to forge a single coherent, effective, communicative team whilst overcoming a range of dissimilarities, ranging from choices of language to commercial attitudes to working practices.<br />
<br />
Participants will learn how we set about the process, and whether it was successful or not. They will also gain some insight into the cultural differences between agile and non-agile teams.<br />
