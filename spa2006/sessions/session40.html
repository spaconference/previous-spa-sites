	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">In this workshop, we will work with the audience to explore the use of metrics to influence the evolution of development teams in a genuinely agile approach to Software Process Improvement. Our ideas are informed by recent experiences at a leading health insurance provider.<br />
<br />
We will experiment with a selection of established performance and quality metrics and test their design to see what kind of behaviours they might encourage when they’re applied. We will also explore “gaming” of metrics by development teams to hit performance targets without  achieving the desired effects, and try to propose changes to the design of each metric which might make it more robust. <br />
<br />
Finally,  we will consider the relationships between the selected metrics, and how a change in one might have an impact on other aspects of team performance.<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Audience background:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">The workshop is aimed at anyone who  is interested in improving the performance of their development teams, regardless of whether they are from a technical, analysis or management background. It should also be of interest to consultants and practitioners who are interested in agile approaches to Software Process Improvement.</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Benefits of participating:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Participants will gain a new perspective on team performance and Software Process Improvement. They will be introduced to a lightweight, evolutionary and goal-driven approach to SPI that is driven by factual information rather than personal opinions.<br />
They will also take away a set of candidate performance metrics that they can apply to their own projects and insight into the design and balanced application of metrics.  We hope that the workshop will act as a springboard for ongoing collaboration and the further development of these ideas.<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">The workshop will begin with a short (< 20 mins) presentation to introduce key concepts in complex, adaptive systems theory and their application to software development organisations. In particular, we will focus on the use of Adaptive Tension (here in the form of measures) to influence the evolution of development capability, and the need for frequent iterations and constant feedback to accelerate organizational learning.<br />
<br />
We will then present a selection of key performance and quality metrics we would like the participants to consider. (< 20 mins)<br />
<br />
The audience will be split into small cross-discipline teams  and each team will be assigned 1-2 metrics to work on. Some teams may work on the same metric to see if they reach different conclusions.<br />
<br />
Each team will identify and articulate the goal of the metric: what outcome is this designed to measure?<br />
<br />
They will then try to “game” the metric, considering scenarios where a development team might show good performance in the metric without actually achieving the desired result.<br />
<br />
They will consider how each metric could be redesigned, combined with other metrics or implemented so that it is less easy to “game”.<br />
<br />
After about an hour, a member of each team will present their findings and the whole group will review and discuss the redesigned metrics. <br />
<br />
In the remaining time, participants will work in their original teams and consider the relationships between all of the metrics presented. They will construct a “strategy map” that shows how the value of one metric might have an effect on the value of other metrics – ideally articulating the nature of this relationship and suggesting a cause.<br />
<br />
Finally, one member of each team will present their strategy maps and these will be reviewed and discussed by the whole group.<br />

	<tr><td>1. Jason Gorman<i><br>parlezuml.com</i><br /><br />Hi

I'm an independent consultant who specialises in agile approaches to software process improvement. I also run a web site called parlezuml.com ( http://www.parlezuml.com ) that offers classroom-based and self-paced training in UML and OOA/D, as well as agile development, designed especially for .NET and Java Developers. I also run a very successful haf-day seminar called UML for Managers that quickly introduces modeling newbies and non-technical people to UML and it's applications in software analysis and design, business modeling, service-oriented and enterprise architecture. You can download a free e-book version oif the material from the site, as well as free sample modules from all my courses. (I think that's probably enough plugs!)
