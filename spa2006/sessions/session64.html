	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">One of the core XP quality practices is test-first development. Yet it can be hard to specify and agree rigorous tests early in a project where the service to be developed is a web application that will be delivered largely by configuring off-the-shelf components. Often, clients will assume that the vendors' rigorous QA testing of their products is sufficient to guarantee the correct working of the completed service - but delivery of the service may have entailed the writing of tens or even thousands of lines of configuration code (e.g. rules), whose correctness has to be tested.<br />
<br />
Until the platform has been delivered and deployed, at least in the development environment, it is usually not possible to understand properly how to interface the test harness to it, let alone how the internal logic works and therefore what test cases might be needed. Yet relying on user stories or business use-cases is usually insufficient as a specification of the tests to be carried out, because they leave out all the exception processing branches.<br />
<br />
The methodology described here can be applied successfully to any project with characteristics similar to the above. It allows test data and test cases (the "test model") to be specified in outline and gradually refined as more information becomes available. All the while, the human-readable test documentation can be re-generated on demand for review by the customer. Once the required level of detail has been input to the test model, theoretically the test harness can be generated and run automatically (this last step has yet to be proven in practice).<br />
<br />
The most recent application of this methodology has been during the implementation of an Internet content filter for a mobile ISP. Modelling of the tests began very early in the project and was successful in eliciting detailed requirements from the customer. Later, the HttpUnit product was selected as the means of implementing the tests, and translation of the test specification into Java code proved remarkably straightforward. Some results will be presented.<br />
<br />
If we were doing this again, we would try very hard to find a way of generating the unit test code from the XML of the test model instead of hand-translating. Although it saved effort in the first pass, maintaining the test specification in synch with the regression test suite has proved time-consuming and tedious.<br />
<br />
Everyone should be convinced of the benefits of test-first development by now. The technique presented here provides an additional level of abstraction, which has a number of benefits:<br />
<br />
* by modularising and orthogonalising the elements of the test model, it makes it much easier for multiple developers to collaborate on creating and maintaining the test harness<br />
<br />
* by abstracting the description of tests into XML, reusable test assets are created. From this model, both a human-readable test specification and (theoretically) an executable test harness can be generated<br />
<br />
* traceability of requirements to test cases and vice versa is easier to maintain and demonstrate, which makes it very straightforward to measure test coverage.</td></tr>

This is preceded by a presentation about test-first development and the theory of the particular technique employed here. We conclude with a number of suggested avenues for further refinement of the technique, and hopefully some questions and answers.<br />
<br />
We would consider following up with a 75-minute practical workshop if the programme committee considers it worth the effort of preparing one.</td></tr>
