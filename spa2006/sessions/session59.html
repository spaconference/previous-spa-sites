	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Ruby is an elegant, dynamically typed Object-Oriented scripting language that has steadily gained in popularity over the last 10 years. Rails is an open-source Agile Web Application Framework built on top of Ruby. Rails emphasizes convention over configuration and strives for simplicity and the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself). It has attracted much interest over the last year, and has done much to promote the Ruby language itself.<br />
<br />
Rails is based on a Model-View-Controller paradigm and incorporates a number of design patterns, such as ActiveRecord for persistence, which simplify common development tasks. Rails also has strong support for AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XmlHttpRequest), a popular way of developing next-generation browser based interfaces as evinced by Google Maps and the like. Rails is however more than just a development framework as it includes many useful scripts for the creation of new components, a complete testing framework and a build language. <br />
<br />
Extravagant claims have been made for productivity gains using Rails - some say it is ten times faster than traditional development techniques. There is only one way to find out - try it for yourselves!<br />

<br />
* Present the brief history and overview of Ruby and Rails. Summarise resources available to support Rails development.<br />
<br />
* Explain how hands on sessions will work. <br />
<br />
* Split the participants up into groups (individuals is possible as well). <br />
[How many machines will we have? Can we pre-install Ruby, Rails & MySQL and various scripts/code files?]<br />
<br />
* In first hands-on session introduce Webrick server and basic Rails components. Generate initial scaffolded app, then extend to customise behaviour.<br />
<br />
* In second hands-on session introduce AJAX capabilities, routes, unit testing framework, intractive debugger (if time!)<br />
<br />
* Summary of topics covered (and not covered!), feedback, questions and close.<br />
<br />
* !!! ALTERNATIVE - in a more Agile fashion, we could let the delegates choose an application and define requirements, and we'd work together to help them build it, small bits at a time. Which approach would be more appealing?<br />
