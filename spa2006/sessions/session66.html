	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">As Unified Modelling Language (UML) becomes an important standard, users are realising that the syntactic description of data-centric domains using UML class diagrams provides an incomplete solution. Additional constraints are required in order to represent all but the most simple business domains. The Object Constraint Language (OCL) is provided as a part of the UML standard for the purpose of describing constraints over UML models. It has a technical syntax based partly upon the Smalltalk programming language underpinned by set theory and predicate logic. It has been argued that formal languages such as OCL are not suitable for domain experts who possess business knowledge but lack technical skills. <br />
<br />
Whether this is true or not, it remains a fact that OCL is rarely used to complete UML class diagrams in software projects. When text is used to augment class diagrams it is rarely complete, consistent and correct, thus leading to poorly specified UML models which in turn contribute to ambiguous requirements specifications, causing projects to over-run and / or produce poor quality software. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, a precise language that can be computer processed is a prerequisite for model driven development and clearly it would seem desirable to be able to complete the specification in a language that a non-technical user can understand.<br />
<br />
This session presents a controlled natural language syntax as an alternative concrete syntax of OCL. The controlled language is a subset of English, which is designed for use with UML class models. This means that whilst business rules usually read just like plain English, the restricted grammar prescribes a fixed structure that must be followed. The complete English language is powerful, but it is ambiguous and much  richer than is necessary for the task of specifying constraints over business data. The advantage of a restricted grammar is that it can be interpreted by software, thereby enabling automated generation of code directly from rules written by business analysts.<br />
<br />
Using a natural language-based approach helps keep business rules readable and visible to stakeholders, rather than hiding their business constraints as hard-coded rules in application programs. It also eliminates the error-prone manual translations normally required to proceed from business analysis to system implementation.<br />
<br />
Objectives:<br />
- Introduce audience to the syntax of NRL and explain how it can be used to complete UML calss diagrams.<br />
- Allow the audience to write some rules against a sample model.<br />
- Extend our understanding of what it means to provide a precise specification and posibly generate code or some other representation.<br />
- Demonstrate code generation using the NRL.<br />

	<tr><td>1. Robert James<i><br>HSBC</i><br /><br />Robert James has been involved with object technology since 1991 when he first used Smalltalk/V. This experience has included involvement in most aspects of the software development process but the primary focus has always been on modelling and design.

His current role within HSBC involves the creation and management of precisely specified models as the basis for large-scale systems integration. The process makes use of transformation technologies, enabling business experts to contribute directly to information models which are used to generate xml schemas, java ‘business rule’ components and a testing framework

He is a regular speaker at SPA (formally OT) conferences and other events.
