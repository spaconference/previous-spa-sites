<br />
The objective of this session is to introduce participants to the "Thinking Processes" of the Theory of Constraints and to let them practise by applying these problem solving tools to agile software development.<br />
<br />
Contents<br />
<br />
This session gives an interactive introduction to the "Thinking Processes" of the Theory of Constraints. The Thinking Tools provide a set of processes, techniques and diagrams to analyze:<br />
* where we are<br />
* where we want to go<br />
* what's keeping us from getting there<br />
* how to resolve conflicts<br />
<br />
We will explore the following tools:<br />
* the ''Current Reality Tree'' describes the current system, to clarify and reach consensus about where we are.<br />
* the ''Future Reality Tree'' describes the situation as we would like it to be<br />
* the ''Negative Branch Reservations'' allow us describe the obstacles that hinder us in reaching the desired future reality and negative effects that may arise from the future reality. These are the obstacles we need to overcome to make the change.<br />
* the ''Evaporating cloud'' allows us to examine conflicts and the assumptions underlying them, so that we can resolve the conflict. <br />
<br />
The tools will be applied to situations involving the transition to Agile processes. These analyses will therefore be recognizable and relevant to the participants. The participants can contribute their experiences to enrich the core problem.<br />

	<tr><td>1. Pascal Van Cauwenberghe<i><br>Nayima</i><br /><br />Pascal is an independent consultant. He has more than 10 years of experience in designing and implementing object oriented software (and building the teams that build the software) and still hopes he will get it right one day.

He's currently convinced that technology doesn't matter (much) and only evolves slowly anyway. It's the people stuff that matters. Which means he has to start learning again.

He co-authored the XpGame[http://www.xp.be/xpgame/] and co-organized the Belgian XP User's group[http://www.xp.be/] meetings with VeraPeeters. They hosted the XP Game simulation at XP2001, XP Universe 2001, OT2002 and at several companies transitioning to XP. </td></tr>
	<tr><td>2. Marc Evers<i><br>KNAW</i><br /><br />Marc Evers helps developers, customers, and project managers in co-creating value through meaningful projects, by coaching, consulting, and developing software. Since 2000, he co-organizes workshops and conferences (XP Day Benelux: http://www.xpday.net and Agile Open: http://www.agileopen.net) based on systems thinking, XP, and agile values, principles, and practices. 

Marc Evers currently works for the KNAW (Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences) in The Netherlands.
