	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Outsourcing, offshoring, nearshoring, smartsourcing and other variants of <br />
getting work done by cheaper staff in other places are now common in most <br />
large IT organisations.  The question is, as reflective practitioners, can <br />
we work with this development in order to deliver better, cheaper systems <br />
for our customers or is such a decision always a negative development?<br />
<br />
This workshop is divided into two halves in order to consider this question.<br />
<br />
The first half of the workshop will ask participants to consider the various<br />
variants of outsourcing as possible ways to develop IT systems and<br />
ask them to consider the issues and positive or negative connotations of each. We<br />
will look at the question from several perspectives, including an onshore<br />
developer, development management, support staff and the ultimate customer.<br />
<br />
In the second half of the workshop, we will assume that a decision has already<br />
been made to outsource some significant part of the software development<br />
effort for a particular project.  In the light of this development,<br />
participants will consider ways that they, as senior developers, architects,<br />
managers or business analysts, can work with the outsourced staff in order<br />
to ensure that an acceptable result is reached for the project's<br />
stakeholders.</td></tr>

	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Benefits of participating:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">* The chance to consider the possible ways that different outsourced<br />
  development models could be applied and the possible implications<br />
  of each.<br />
  <br />
* The identification of a set of practices that could be used to control<br />
  and manage outsourced development in order to deliver an effective<br />
  system.  Such practices could well be of use in more traditional<br />
  development situations too (such as using contract or software house<br />
  staff on a project).<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">* Introduce the objectives of the session and the process to be used.<br />
* Present a number of possible models of outsourced development, from<br />
  total organisational outsourcing to "body shopping" where commodity<br />
  resources are used from another organisation as part of a project.<br />
<br />
* Split into up to 4 groups and undertake first group exercise: "Trick or Treat?".  <br />
  In this exercise, the groups will consider some of the essential variables<br />
  for an outsourced project, including:<br />
<br />
      Size of project<br />
      Level of ceremony<br />
      Type of project<br />
      Domain (well-known vs obscure, technical vs business, local rules, etc.)<br />
<br />
  Given different types of outsourcing (such as remote developers,<br />
  entire technical team remote, entire project remote), the groups will<br />
  be asked to work out lists of issues that they could forsee<br />
  in different combinations of variables vs. outsourcing types<br />
  and which stakeholders (developers, managers, architects, business<br />
  sponsors etc.) are impacted by these issues in a positive or negative way.<br />
<br />
* Collate the results of the first exercise using flip charts to<br />
  get a general view on types of project where outsourcing is considered<br />
  positive or negative.<br />
<br />
* Split into two groups, undertake the second exercise: "That's easy for you to say!"<br />
  In this exercise, the groups are given a project scenario with a set of<br />
  variables as above. The "internal" team take on stakeholder roles while the<br />
  "external" team takes on development/project team roles (PM, designer,<br />
  team lead, etc.). The two groups will then prepare for and conduct an<br />
  initial "project kick-off meeting". Each group is given an "agenda" to pursue<br />
  in the course of this meeting. The objective is to see which of the issues<br />
  from the first exercise come up during the meeting and to see what proposed<br />
  solutions evolve.<br />
<br />
* Present a couple of slides containing initial thoughts on possible<br />
  mechanisms for assessing, controlling and managing outsourced<br />
  development.<br />
<br />
* In the original groups, undertake the third exercise: "Damage Limitation"<br />
  In this exercise, the groups will identify possible sets of practices<br />
  to address some of the issues discovered and to help them ensure cost effective,<br />
  low risk delivery of their project using the outsourced model.<br />
<br />
* Each group presents their overall findings in rough categories:<br />
  (A) Can this outsourcing be a positive development?<br />
  (B) Who gets affected by it and how do their jobs change?<br />
  (C) How do the onshore staff run the project to get it delivered?<br />
<br />
* Summary and recap.<br />
