	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Part of the job of the software architect is to create a coherent and useful architectural description so that the architecture of their system can be communicated to and understood by interested stakeholders (including the architect himself).<br />
<br />
UML is the defacto standard language for describing software models, butit is primarily an object-oriented software design notation and many architects find it difficult to express their ideas using it.<br />
<br />
Alternatives to UML have been proposed in both the academic community (in the form of ADLs like ACME, xADL and Wright) and the industrial community(for example Gregor Holpe's "gregorgrams" notation used in his EAI patterns book).  However, these alternatives have not been widely adopted by information systems practitioners.<br />
<br />
This situation means that many architects end up inventing their own informal architectural design notations in order to describe their systems. This can be problematic for a number of reasons, not least the wasted effort involved in repeatedly reinventing notations, confusing inconsistency between architectural descriptions and the likelihood of confusion and misunderstanding when stakeholders need to understand and interpret new notations.<br />
<br />
This workshop will attempt to identify the key requirements of a language for describing software architectures and consider how (or if) UML is lacking as a solution to them.  Participants will then attempt to improve on UML by sketching their own visual language for defining software architectures.</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">1. Introduce the objectives of the session and the process to be used.<br />
<br />
2. Present a couple of examples of using UML for architectural description,  pointing out how little information is really present in the standard notation.  The presentation will then recap the importance of stakeholders in architectural design and the wide range of stakeholders that need to be served.  We will also explain how a view-based approach to architectural description can help to communicate across a wide stakeholder community and suggest a standard set of views to consider (functional, concurrency, information, development, deployment and  operational).<br />
<br />
3. Split into groups and undertake first group exercise: "Who, What, How?" In this exercise the participants will consider which stakeholders need to understand which of the views in an architectural description, and what they need to understand from each. Then, for each view and stakeholder pair, they will identify the key requirement for communicating that part of the description to the stakeholder in question (e.g. "ease of understanding", "precision", "rapid assimilation", "overview", "details" and so on).<br />
<br />
4. Collate the results of the first exercise using flip chart sheets on the walls.<br />
<br />
5. Present a couple of slides containing our view of UML as an architectural  description language (which is that it has its limitations, to say the least).<br />
<br />
6. In the same groups, undertake the second exercise: "UML, Friend or Foe?" In this exercise, the groups will decide how well standard UML meets each of the requirements identified in the first exercise, by considering how effective it would be at communicating with each of the stakeholder groups considered in the first exercise.<br />
<br />
7. Collate the results of the second exercise using flip charts on the walls.<br />
<br />
8. Again in the same groups, undertake the third exercise "Quivering at Arrows".  In this exercise, the groups will attempt to improve on UML by sketching a  better architectural description language.  This should identify the  entities that can be represented, their semantics and relationships and the graphical notation to be used for each.  Some example UML architectural description fragments will be provided to provide groups with concrete examples to work with.<br />
<br />
9. Each group presents their language.<br />

10. Summary and recap.<br />

	<tr><td>1. Eoin Woods<i><br>UBS Investment Bank</i><br /><br />Eóin Woods has been working in software engineering of some sort since 1990.  He has worked for a number of companies in that time, including Ford, Group Bull, Sybase, InterTrust and Zuhlke, as well as working as an independent consultant for a spell. Today, Eoin is employed as an internal consultant architect by a global investment bank, where he works across the business lines of the bank as project needs arise. 

For those who were wondering, you pronounce Eóin's name "Owen".  It's an Irish name (Eóin originally hailing from Northern Ireland).  To find out more about Irish names, take a look at http://www.faqs.org/faqs/cultures/irish-faq/part09/.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>2. Nick Rozanski<i><br>Marks and Spencer plc</i><br /><br />I am a Technical Architect with Marks and Spencer plc based in London, UK. My portfolio includes enterprise integration, business process management (aka workflow) and business intelligence.

I have worked in IT since 1979. Prior to joining M&S, I was a Technical Architect at French Thornton and CGEY and a Principal Consultant at Sybase Professional Services. I have also worked for Praxis and Logica. Over the years I have taken senior roles on projects for a wide range of public and private sector clients.

As a Technical Architect, I am involved in creating and documenting the architectural strategy and vision, promoting this amongst stakeholders and working with programmes and projects to turn it into reality. My technology background includes enterprise application integration, package implementation, relational database, data replication, and object-oriented software development.

I have a book on software architecture with EoinWoods. It's called "Software Systems Architecture" and you can find out about it here: http://www.viewpoints-and-perspectives.info/

I play first violin for the Kingston Chamber Orchestra (for whom I am also the Webmaster). We rehearse weekly and perform three or four concerts a year. Our repertoire ranges from the Baroque period through to the twentieth century, including some specially-commissioned pieces. 

I am also an Urgent Action letter writer for Amnesty International.</td></tr>
