	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">A short presentation (and demonstration using tools created by the leader) of how syndication technology is relevant to various parts of an organization.  By syndication technology, I mean:<br />
<br />
RSS/Atom (syndicated content)<br />
News Aggregators (for consuming syndicated content)<br />
Syndication search (for consuming specific content)<br />
Blogs (for pushing out your own message)<br />
<br />
All of this is relevant for people in the following parts of an organization (not limited to a software development organization):<br />
<br />
Product Managers<br />
Project Leaders<br />
PR staff<br />
Product Marketers<br />
General Marketing staff<br />
<br />
For all of these people, syndication technology is introducing a wild card into how they deal with their prospects and customers - PR staff in particular are being impacted.  In general, I tell people that this new space brings this to the forefront:<br />
<br />
"Either go out and define your message, or other people will define it for you"<br />
(See Jeff Jarvis and Dell Hell for an example of this).<br />
<br />
I expect to give a short presentation, followed by a discussion with the audience.</td></tr>

	<tr><td>1. James A. Robertson<i><br>Cincom Systems, Inc.</i><br /><br />I started my career as a teacher, spending almost three years at that.  I moved on to software development with the US government, and shorthly thereafter moved into consulting work with Booz-Allen and Hamilton.  After three years of various sorts of work there, I discovered Smalltalk.  I soon joined ParcPlace, first as a trainer/consultant, and then as a sales engineer.  I stayed with the Smalltalk team through various convulsions of the company and ended up at Cincom when VisualWorks was acquired in 1999.  I have since become the Product Manager for Cincom Smalltalk, which consists of VisualWorks and ObjectStudio (another Smalltalk dialect).  </td></tr>
