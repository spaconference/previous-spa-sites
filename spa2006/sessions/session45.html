	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">To take a simple example, you could view the happening of someone renting a video as a change in a point-of-sale world (something to be paid for was added to an ongoing sale) or as a change in the rental world (a new rental agreement was made). You could model from other points of view, too, such as stock management and customer handling. <br />
<br />
You could try to model all these views at once. Or you could model them separately, and later combine them. How might you combine the business rules concerning adding a sale item to a sale with those concerning making a new rental agreement? Modellers working for InferData are often able to use a disarmingly simple answer: logical-and. (For those who know Catalysis, the approach uses the idea of effects.)<br />
<br />
The session will present a simplified case study (video rentals), built on ideas arising in modelling work carried out for several clients. The presenter's goals for the session are:<br />
<br />
- to show you a way to combine views of a single happening<br />
<br />
- to show how this can be done even in very precise models<br />
<br />
- to explore with you where best to exploit the technique.</td></tr>

	<tr><td>1. Richard Mitchell<i><br>InferData Ltd and Mitchell Horvath Ltd</i><br /><br />Richard trains and consults in the general area of object-oriented analysis and design.

He is particularly interested in approaches that 
include modeling the world into which systems are 
to be placed. His preferred approach uses the ideas of design by contract to add precision to models where needed. This is not surprising when you know that Richard is lead author of the book 

    Design by Contract, by Example, 

published by Addison-Wesley, 2002.
