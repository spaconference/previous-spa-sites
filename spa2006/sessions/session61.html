	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Business software development is mostly done by project teams that have a captive user base. Perhaps that's why they usually skip the process of defining a target market for their software, unlike product development teams. But perhaps project teams should think about their users, and their users' goals and motivation, in a similar way as product teams do? This workshop shows how designing a shrink-wrapped box for your software can be a fun and productive way of bringing effective user driven design techniques into your project.</td></tr>

<br />
Timetable:<br />
Activity / Allotted Time <br />
Introduction / 5 mins<br />
Identifying user groups and goals / 15 mins<br />
Writing the elevator pitch / 15 mins<br />
Designing the box / 15 mins<br />
Exhibition / 15 mins<br />
Wrap up / 10 mins<br />
<br />
Art materials in the form of flip charts, marker pens, and scrap paper should be available. The workshop requires a room with plenty of available wall space, where seating or tables can be easily rearranged.</td></tr>
