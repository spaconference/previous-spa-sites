	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">The Sun SPOT is a small low-cost battery-powered computing device that can be connected to a variety of transducers and can communicate wirelessly with similar devices. It runs a Java operating system, and both device drivers and applications are written in Java. This is unusual - software for these kinds of devices is typically written in C or C-like languages.<br />
<br />
The nature of these devices opens up a whole new field of possible applications. The purpose of this session is to expose participants to the possibilities, and give them the opportunity of building applications that explore this space.<br />
<br />
Working in groups, participants will create versions of an application that can be tested during the remainder of the conference. The exact nature of this application is to be decided, but one possibility would be a system for gauging opinion during keynotes or other sessions.<br />

<br />
Participants will need to bring laptops. We'll provide the development tools, although we'd like participants to pre-install some stuff to save time.<br />

	<tr><td>1. John Daniels<i><br>Syntropy Limited</i><br /><br />John Daniels is an object technology pioneer, with over 20 years experience of object/component modelling, design, development.

John has been a session leader at every OT/SPA conference, and has a track-record of enthusiastic participant response and high ratings (provided you ignore OT2003!).

	<tr><td>2. John S. Nolan<i><br>Finetix</i><br /><br />I have worked for too many years creating object-oriented software for both commercial and enterprise groups in engineering, finance, advertising and electronic commerce. </p>

I subscribe to the Extreme Programming approach. In 1999, I founded Connextra along with PeterMarks. We developed many ideas around the core of XP to make it a workable set of practices for a business. Connextra is possibly the world's longest running XP Project.</p> 

I was recently working for Sun Microsystems Research Laboratories in Scotland/Grenoble/PaloAlto. Ran a team that deliverd a complete Hardware and software wireless transducer system in 6 months - ARM processor, 802.15.4 wireless and a Java VM running it all the way down to the metal, in under 400Kb combined ROM/RAM</p> 

I now work for http://www.finetix.com bringing Agile/XP to Capital Markets</p></td></tr>
