				<h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
  <h2>Leading a session</h2>
  <h3>Fees/Payment</h3>
  Those leading a session will pay only &pound;500 + VAT for the conference including 
  accommodation and meals. Session leaders must book and pay for their places 
  BEFORE 15th December. <br />
  <br />
  <h3>Joint/multiple proposals</h3>
  While potential session leaders are invited to submit as many proposals as they 
  wish, they should be aware that accepted sessions will be limited to one individual 
  session or two joint sessions per leader. Sunday working groups are excluded 
  from this ruling and may therefore be led in addition to the above ruling.<br />
  <br />
  If a session has more than two leaders, then only the first two named leaders 
  will qualify for booking at the session leader rate of &pound;500 + VAT.<br />
  <br />
  <h3>Conditions of inclusion in programme</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Final acceptance of proposal will be at the complete discretion of the 
      Programme Chair.<br />
    </li>
    <li>By agreeing to have the session included in the programme the session 
      leader is committing to:<br />
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Book and pay for their conference booking before 15th December 2005</li>
        <li>Participate in the shepherding process to ensure high session quality</li>
        <li>Supply all materials relating to the session by 6th February 2006</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>The session leader grants the SPA Specialist Group the right to reproduce 
      and distribute (in printed, on-line and CD formats) all materials submitted 
      for the session. The copyright of the materials remains with the original 
      copyright holder. Where copyright is held by a person other than the session 
      leader, it is the session leaders responsibility to ensure appropriate permission 
      to use is secured.<br />
    </li>
    <li>In the unlikely event that Programme Chair, at their absolute discretion, 
      decides that the session leader has not complied with these terms and conditions, 
      they may remove the session from the Programme. The session leader may no 
      longer then be eligible for reduced rate participation in the conference 
      and thus will be given the option of either a refund of any fees paid or 
      the option to pay the additional fees necessary to allow them to continue 
      to participate.</li>
  </ol>

  <br>
  <h2>Participating in the Conference</h2>
  <h3>Making and paying for a booking</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>There are a limited number of participant places available for the conference. 
      Bookings are processed in the order they are received and a booking has 
      not be accepted by SPA Specialist Group until a confirmation email has been 
      sent.</li>
    <li>Those booking at a rate other than &quot;standard&quot; may need to provide 
      additional information to verify that they qualify for that rate. This may 
      include BCS or SPA membership numbers, a purchase order from recognised 
      educational establishment etc.</li>
    <li>By placing a booking, the participant has agreed to the terms and conditions 
      listed here. </li>
    <li>Booking should normally be accompanied by payment, either by Credit/Debit 
      Card or via cheque or money order made payable to BCS SPA Specialist Group. 
    </li>
    <li>All payments must be received before the conference. </li>
    <li>Invoices may be issued but normally require an official company order 
      number. Once issued, an invoice remains payable regardless of and subject 
      to our cancellation policies. (i.e. Canceling a booking not yet paid for 
      does not negate the need to pay for it! A partial credit note may be issued 
      against the invoice in line with our Cancellations and Refunds policy).</li>
    <li>All invoices must be paid within 30 days. The SPA Specialist Group reserves 
      the right to charge interest on weekly basis on overdue invoices at the 
      published Lloyds TSB Base Rate + 1%. </li>
    <li>Once a booking has been made, any early-bird discount can only be secured 
      by full-payment before the relevant early-bird deadlines 
      <h3></h3>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Accommodation</h3>
  Accommodation in the main conference venue is limited and will be allocated 
    a first come, first served basis. Overflow accommodation of a similar quality 
    may be provided nearby. Even when delegates are in overflow accommodation, 
    they will eat main meals, take part in social activities etc with the delegates 
    in the main venue. <br />
  <br />
  
    <h3>Why accommodation must be booked as part of the conference booking</h3>
  A key aspect of the culture of the SPA conference is its residential nature. 
    Participants not only meet and interact with each other in the formal programme 
    but also at meals, in social activities and simply by being in the same physical 
    space. The conference would offer considerably less value to its participants 
    if some people were not resident.<br>
  <br>
    Given the above, the agreement the organisers have with the venue is based 
    on a residential model. Our very low participation fees for the conference 
    are only possible BECAUSE we commit to booking our accommodation at the venue 
    too. If some participants were allowed to book accommodation separately, the 
    costs for everyone would increase!<br>
  <br>
  For the above reasons, we are not able to offer not residential places at the SPA conference.<br>
  <br>  
  <h3>Cancellation And Refunds</h3>
  All bookings at the conference are subject to our standard <a href="refundsandcancellations.html">Cancellations 
  and Refunds</a> Policy. <br />
  <br />
  <h3>Delegates with Special Needs</h3>
  The SPA conference aims to be fully accessible to all its delegates. A limited 
  number of bedrooms at the venue have been designed for disabled delegates. Each 
  room is spacious, fitted with easy-access bathrooms, emergency cords, and appropriate 
  fittings. Please call the conference administrators to discuss any specific 
  needs before booking.<br />

    that information they provide will be held on computer databases for administrative 
    purposes. Summary information, including contact data, will be published on

    opt-out of having this information published. Information about participants 
    (but not other registered users of this website) will be made available to
