				  <H1>Session formats</H1>
  The Software Practice Advancement conference has a tradition of active participation. 
  We encourage conference sessions that bring people together to work and learn 
  and in most cases, sessions are highly interactive, involving participants and 
  session leaders on an equal footing. The types of session that typically make 
  up the programme are described here, although if you are proposing a session 
  and want to do something different, we always welcome new suggestions. <BR>
  <BR>
  <A name=WS> </A>
  <H2>Workshop</H2>
   
  <H3>75 or 150 minutes</H3>
  Interactive, structured session in which participants work on a topic and normally
  produce in some conclusions (which are made available to other SPA participants)
  together with suggestions for avenues for further investigation.
  <br><br>
  Workshops may take many different forms 
  and submitters are free to propose their own structure and process. It is very 
  important that proposals are explicit about the process that will be followed. 
  <BR>
  <BR>
  <A name=TU> </A>
  <H2>Tutorial</H2>
   
  <H3>75 or 150 minutes</H3>
  A presentation on a clearly focussed topic aimed at a defined category of software
  professional. Contains formal lecturing, but should also incorporate some interaction
  between participants.  150 minute slots are also available on the Sunday for introductory
  tutorials on basics delegates may have missed first-time around.
  <br><br>
  For example a tutorial could 
  be aimed at experienced project managers, or at professionals actively working 
  on object-oriented design projects. You should have a clear idea of what insights 
  your participants will take away, and why they will find these interesting. 
  While tutorials are expected to contain a certain amount of formal lecturing, 
  you should try to incorporate a degree of interaction between participants, 
  for example by including a quiz or questionnaire. <BR>
  <BR>
  <A name=GB> </A>
  <H2>Goldfish Bowl</H2>
   
  <H3>75 or 150 minutes</H3>
  A structured discussion format.  Goldfish bowls generally require an initial seed
  group of four or five specially invited participants, with the rest of the participants
  beginning as the audience and then swapping in and out with the participants.
  <br><br>
  A goldfish bowl provides an effective means of exploring the breadth of opinion 
  on a given topic. The session is started by a small discussion group of specially
  invited participants, with the rest 
  of the participants forming an audience. Spare places in the discussion group 
  are available, and members of the audience may take up these places when they 
  feel they have a contribution to make. Members of the discussion group leave 
  their places when they have had their say, making room for new participants. 
  The session should produce documentary output of the conclusions reached, typically 
  in the form of a poster. <BR>
  <BR>
  <A name=CS> </A> 
  <H2>Case Study</H2>
  
  <H3>75 or 150 minutes</H3>
  A case study session aims to describe real-life experiences and lessons learnt in
  implementing object technology. Discussion of failure as well as success is welcome. 
  <br><br>
  The experiences described can be drawn from any aspect of object 
  technology projects. Useful topics to address in a case study session would 
  be: background to why object technology was used; report on the experience of 
  using object technology; what went wrong and why; what went well and why; what 
  lessons have been learnt from the experience. <BR>
  <BR>
  <A name=SI> </A>
  <H2>Simulation</H2>
   
  <H3>75 or 150 minutes</H3>
  Reflection on or experimentation with complex real-world environments facilitated
  by means of a simulation, role-play or games.  
  <br><br>
  Given the complexity of the real-world environment in which we practice software, 
  it is often not possible to reflect clearly on the way we work or to expweriment 
  with new approaches. Using simulations and games howwever allows us to think 
  about these situations with increased clarity. A simulation leader will be responsible 
  for producing a clear and concise summary of the purpose, rules, and assumptions 
  of the game. Some work on reflecting on the results of the game and its implications 
  for real-world practice should also be included. The output from the sessions 
  is likely to include both summary results from the simulation and a summary 
  of its real-world implications. <BR>
  <BR>
  <A name=TT> </A>
  <H2>Think Tank</H2>
   
  <H3>75 or 150 minutes</H3>
  A small group of people meeting to solve a particular problem or to find an agreed
  position on some issue. Think-tank sessions are intensive, focused and produce concrete
  outputs. 
  <br><br>
  Think tanks should produce concrete output in the form of a poster for 
  other conference participants. The session leader is responsible for the process 
  of the session, for any materials that may be needed, and for ensuring that 
  the poster is produced. <BR>
  <BR>
  <A name=HT> </A>
  <H2>Hot Topic Presentation</H2>
   
  <H3>20 minutes</H3>
  Short presentations by delegates on a current hot topic of their choice, each lasting
  15 minutes with 10 minutes discussion.  These will be clustered into groups of three and 
  form 75 minutes sessions with a moderator.<BR>
  <BR>
  <A name=WG> </A>
  <H2>Working Group</H2>
   
  <H3>6 hours</H3>
  A working group conducts a detailed exploration of some aspect of technology, to
  identify how that aspect of the technology can be advanced, and then to put in motion
  the work needed to achieve this advance. These normally take place on Sunday afternoon,
  before the main part of the conference and may require some pre-conference input from
  participants (for example submission of a position statement).  
  
  Working groups are run to encourage the exchange of ideas between practitioners 
  with the aim of generating or encouraging progress that is applicable to the 
  software community at large. Groups may continue to meet during and after the
  conference.<BR>
  <BR>
  <A name=PS> </A>
  <H2>Pioneering session types</H2>
   For 2006 a room will be kitted out as a chill-out zone with comfy sofas, wireless
   access and a laid back atmosphere.  While available for much of the time as an informal
   quiet area we also welcome innovative ideas for sessions to be run in this zone. 
   These might include, but are not limited to, any of these:
   <br><br>
	<h3>Sofa Sessions</h3>
	Laid-back chats, discussions and brain-storming on a pre-arranged topic. 
	<br><br>
	<h3>Out-of-the-Box</h3>
	A session taking place in virtual reality making use of the internet, participants’ laptops
	and the wireless network.  This may include virtual participants (present on-line only) or
	interactive group work on a technical problem or a shared investigation.
	<br><br>
	<h3>On the Edge sessions</h3>
	Experiments in ways of working, interacting and transferring knowledge.
	<br><br>
	<h3>Bring a Team</h3>
	Use a Sunday working group slot combined with SPA conference sessions to both build a team
	and explore new technologies and ways of working.
