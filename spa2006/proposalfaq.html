<h1>FAQ: Leading a session at the SPA Conference</h1>
<br>
    <h3>Why submit a session proposal?</h3>
    <ul><li>Your chance to influence the style and content of the conference. </li>
      <li>Opportunity to test ideas with other leading software professional in 
        a safe and supportive environment.</li>
      <li>Opportunity to attend Europe's leading conference for Software Practioners 
        at very low rates.</li>
      <li>Gain valuable feedback and new ideas on challenges facing your projects.</li>
      <li>Increases your own visibility and your organisation visibility within 
        the community of software professionals.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Help, I've never led a session before?</h3>
    Don't worry - the most important thing is to have a good idea - either for 
    the topic to be discussed or the format and process of the session or ideally 
    both! You will need to capture your ideas in to a short web-based form to 
    give the Programme Review Committee the information they will need to assess 
    the session. <br>
<a name="exampleproposals"><br></a>
	We provide examples of previous successful proposals to allow 
    you to see the best way to present the information needed. <br><br>

    We have a well established shepherding process to guide you from the proposal

    <td>Outputs</td>

          the session and a chance for those who could not attend to share some 
          of the learning. They also often act to "ground" the session by forcing 
          participants to come to concrete conclusions. The outputs may initial 
          exists as flip-chart posters, index card sets etc. While these are welcome 
          and are fantastic to display in the public areas of the conference, 
          SPA also asks that session leaders commit to capturing outputs and recording 
          them on the conference wiki for use after the conference.</td>

	<h3>What makes for a good session proposal? </h3>
	A good session proposal will show that you have a clear and interesting idea 
    and that you have thought sufficiently about how the session will operate 
    to ensure that all participants will be able to achieve the stated objectives 
    of the session. To maximise the chances of the session being accepted on to 
    the programme: 
    <ul>
	<li>Ensure the subject matter is relevant to the SPA participants.</li>
	<li>Make it clear what knowledge of the subject you will bring to the session and what 
	experience you expect your participants to have.</li>
	<li>Clearly describe the process for the learning experience.  A high degree of
	interactivity is likely to improve the rating of the proposal.</li>
	<li>Reflect on your own proposal using the sample <a href="reviewformsample.pdf">Review Form</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	Look at some of the <a href="#exampleproposals">proposals</a> which have been successful in 
	the past for suggestions on how best to present your proposal for the different types of 
	session.
	<br><br>

	<h3>What's all this about shepherding?</h3>
	All sessions that are accepted onto the SPA Conference programme are allocated 
    a "shepherd". She/he acts as an independent 3rd party who will give you help 
    and advice on your session as it progresses. The SPA/OT series of conferences 
    has promoted a philosophy of working together in sessions that encourage learning 
    through involvement. There are many way to do this, all rather different from 
    the usual format of presentations, and they have proved popular and effective. 
    However, this does require additional techniques and practices to run effective 
    interactive sessions and these “tricks of the trade” are not easily picked 
    up as most of us do not attend such sessions during our work. The shepherding 
    relationship teams up presenters with experienced session leaders who can 
    collaborate in making sessions truly effective.<br>
    <br>

	The Shepherd's chief role is that of a consultant and mentor, rather than a collaborator or
	helper.  They should ask and answer questions, make suggestions, and refer to relevant sources
    of information rather than write notes or draw diagrams.  They may not be an expert in your 
	subject matter, but they will know a lot about how SPA conference sessions run best.  They 
	will also act as your conscience to ensure you meet deadlines for the submission of materials
	etc.  
	<br><br>
	
	<h3>How are the session proposals reviewed?</h3>
	The session proposals are reviewed by a panel of Software Practioners most of 
    whom have lead very successful sessions at SPA and other conferences. Each 
    proposal is reviewed independently by a number of reviewers. The reviews rate 
    the session using a standardised <a href="reviewformsample.pdf">review form</a>. 
	These reviews 
    then form the basis of a ranking exercise carried about by small panels of 
    reviewers. This then allows us to build a balanced and varied programme based 
    on the best proposals across different topic areas and session types. <br>
	<br>
	The final construction of the programme is the responsibility of the Programme Chair. 
	They will also apply our rules to prevent a single presenter appearing too many times
	on the programme while balancing the range of topics, session formats and durations.
	<br><br>  
	<h3>When will I know if my session has been accepted?</h3>
	We will inform you of the results of the review by the end of October.  You will receive 
	copies of completed review forms for your sessions to assist you in further work on your 
	session and to help you improve future submissions.<br><br>
	
	The decision of the Programme Chair regarding your session will be one of the following:<br><br>
	
	<strong>Accepted on to Programme:</strong>  At this point your session will be included in the 
	Programme.  You will then be expect to comply with the <a href="termsandconditions.html">
	conditions</a> of being a session leader including meeting all booking and materials 
	deadlines.  If you fail to comply we reserve the right to remove your session 
	from the programme at a later date.<br><br>
		
	<strong>Provisionally accepted on to the Programme:</strong>  The Programme Chair would like 
	to include your session in the programme, but the review process will have highlighted some 
	areas of the proposal that need further discussion or modification.  <br><br>
    
	<strong>Held on reserve list:</strong> Since we often have a number of high 
    quality session that we are not able to schedule into the programme initially, 
    we ask to keep some session on a reserve list. We will keep you updated as 
    the continuing status of your proposal while it is on this list. <br>
    <br>
		
	<strong>Not accepted:</strong>  We are not able to accept all sessions submitted even if 
	they are of a high quality, due to our desire to create a well balanced and appropriately 
	varied programme.  If your session was not accepted, we encourage you to still attend and
	participate in the conference.  You may also find you can organise a Birds-of-a-Feather
	session around the topic you wished to consider.
