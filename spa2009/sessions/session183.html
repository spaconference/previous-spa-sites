	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Agile teams want to deliver maximum business value. That's easy if the Onsite Customer assigns business value to each story. But how does the Customer do that? How can you estimate business value?<br />
<br />
How do you decide between stories? How do you decide between projects? How do you decide between clients?<br />
<br />
This session gives you some simple business value estimation techniques that are "good enough" for everyday use.<br />
<br />
The session is run as a game, where teams of 'account managers' have estimate business value and prioritise to make plans for their development team. The goal of the game is to earn as much money as possible by delivering features and stories with the highest possible business value, like in the XP Game.<br />
<br />
Each account manager in the team represents one (or more) clients who will buy the team's product IF their feature(s) is in the product. The team is going to have to make some tough decisions; the team is going to have to disappoint some clients, because the development team has a finite capacity.<br />
<br />
We provide the clients and their wishes. We suggest the techniques to estimate business value. The rest is up to you.<br />
<br />
After the game we look at the different strategies that were used and see how these can be applied to different types of projects.</td></tr>
