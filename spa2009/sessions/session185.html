	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Test Driven Development is one cornerstone of eXtreme Programming and<br />
its advantages are well-known: it guides developers, builds confidence<br />
in the system and provides secure scaffolding to support change.<br />
There are however some drawbacks in using this technique: it is quite<br />
verbose, it places to much emphasis on details, on the 'how' instead of<br />
the 'what', it produces more code that will need to be maintained and<br />
is not very useful to non technical people.<br />
<br />
In this session, we want to explore techniques that keep the spirit of<br />
TDD while being more concise, provides a better abstract view of what<br />
we want to achieve, and may sometimes be more legible. These<br />
techniques are drawn from the functional programming languages tools<br />
and techniques. Functional languages are getting more and more<br />
attention and some of their characteristics may be useful in<br />
increasing software quality.<br />
<br />
This workshop will be a hands-on guided coding party using the pure,<br />
lazy, statically typed language Haskell and providing introduction to<br />
some tools and techniques. Examples in other languages (Java, Scala, Javascript) will also be<br />
provided.<br />
<br />
Its goal is to study and assess each of the following techniques and tools within<br />
the framework of XP practices in order to go *beyond* standard code<br />
quality improvement practices:<br />
 - property-driven test generation with Quickcheck (http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~rjmh/QuickCheck/) and coverage<br />
   assessment with hpc;<br />
 - algebraic datatypes, type classes and polymorphism and how an<br />
   advanced type system can improves the static safety of<br />
   programs; <br />
 - simple equational reasoning or how to prove that one's functions<br />
   work as expected, within some expected bounds.<br />

   of the workshop's time is dedicated to coding and exploration of<br />
   languages,<br />
 - interest for agile practices, more precisely XP coding practices<br />
   and for improving one's own practices,<br />
 - previous exposure to some functional programming language or, even<br />
   better, Haskell definitely a plus.</td></tr>

 - FP are hype (sort of): What benefits could their use really<br />
   provides in terms of quality ? communication ? simplicity ?<br />
   feedback ?<br />
 - Understanding sophisticated (ML style) type system and what are<br />
   they useful for<br />
 - Making things more abstract sometimes make them more simple<br />

 2. a solution is sketched in Haskell and needed infrastructure and<br />
    process are set up,<br />
 3. various kind of development techniques made possible with Haskell<br />
    are introduced, explained and tried on this example, using part of<br />
    the larger problem as motivation:<br />
     1. TDD using property-based test case generation with QuickCheck,<br />
     2. Proper composition of validations and definition of an<br />
        expressive embedded DSL using (and abusing) the type system,<br />
     3. proof of simple properties and complexity measures using<br />
        formal reasoning on equations,<br />
 4. applicability of each of this technique is assessed wrt to<br />
    mainstream agile development practices</td></tr>

  - 20-30' : Process negotiation (10')<br />
     - all coding shall be done in *Randori* mode as in an XP dojo:<br />
       coding is done in pairs, with 5' slots, pilot of pair is<br />
       replaced by copilot and new copilot replace the latter each slot,<br />
     - participants can bring along their own laptop, a Mercurial<br />
       repository will be shared<br />
     - guidelines for setting up development environment will be<br />
       provided <br />

     - 30': coding rounds<br />
 - 65-100' :Second problem: advanced properties of the type system for static<br />
   validation of expressions (35')<br />
     - same format as first problem<br />
 - 100-135' : Third problem: equational reasoning and complexity analysis with<br />
   pure functions (35')<br />
