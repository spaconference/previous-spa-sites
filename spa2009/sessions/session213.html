	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">In "More Secrets of Consulting" Gerald Weinberg introduces a consultant's tool kit and mentions several tools that help a consultant do his job well. <br />
<br />
In this workshop we will spend some time analysing the tools in our personal tool kit and then presenting those to the others.<br />
<br />
We will start out by defining the term "tool" - here we will differentiate between technical tools (i.e. cool tools that make working with the computer simpler), soft skill tools and process tools.<br />
<br />
After this every participant will be asked to spend some time capturing his "best" tools on a form with questions such as: <br />
- Description of tool<br />
- Which problem does this tool solve?<br />
- Are there any risks involved using this tool?<br />
- Are there any limitations to using this tool?<br />
<br />
In the next step each participant will join up with another participant so they can review each other's "tools" and help formulate them so a third person is able to understand them from just reading the form.<br />
<br />
After this the tools are presented to the group and captured on a board.<br />
<br />
In the remaining time we will divide into smaller groups and try to find tools that could help solve concrete problems participants might have. <br />
The outcomes will then - again - be presented to the group<br />

0:20 - 0:35 participants spend time writing down their tools and defining what problem the tool solves.<br />
0:35 - 0:50 participants pair up and review each other's person's tools asking questions such as: Is there any information missing so I could put this tool into practice? Are there any limitations to using this tool?<br />
0:50 - 1:05 Tools are presented to the group<br />
1:05 - 1:20 Brainstorming in the group about problems that people would like tools to be able to solve them. I will be gathering these problems and pinning them up. <br />
1:20 - 1:30 people walk around, adding tools that might help solve these problems on cards and finally grouping around problems they think they could participate in finding tools to help solve.<br />
1:30 - 2:00 The groups around problem cards spend time brainstorming about and noting down tools to solve the problem<br />
2:00 - 2:30 presentation of the results and feedback<br />
