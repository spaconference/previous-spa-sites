Have you ever wondered why? Do you run regular retrospectives or similar activities to try to break the cycle but still don't feel your making any significant progress? Then this session is for you.<br />
<br />
Rob Bowley and Matt Wynne sincerely believe that regularly taking time to reflect with your colleagues, identifying your most pressing problems and tackling them is the centre pin of any self-respecting software team. However, even these sessions (usually called retrospectives) quickly become tired and repetitive, often never achieve their intended goals and even get dropped completely (big mistake).<br />
<br />
Content:<br />
This is a lowdown get-your-hands-dirty workshop. Participants will be spending most of their time solving each others problems and trading ideas on how to make the most effective use of your time spent retrospecting within your organisations.<br />
<br />
Objective:<br />
To share our problems with retrospecting activities and find solutions to them. Also to create a directory of tools, tips and tricks which we'll be able to refer to when planning retrospective exercises in the future.</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Audience background:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">No particular experience of "agile" retrospectives is necessary and this may be an excellent introduction to the value they can provide. Anyone who is interested in getting the most out of their teams and processes would benefit from attending.</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Benefits of participating:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">To be able to discuss and solve your retrospective problems with peers and create a directory of resources which you will later be able to refer to when running retrospectives. For those new to retrospecting, to get a good understanding of the benefits and common pitfalls of retrospectives and to learn how to be able to run them themselves.</td></tr>
