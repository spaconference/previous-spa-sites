	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">We have always found Java web development to be a pain. There's always some dodgy javascript, or some auto-magical wiring you have to figure out - otherwise misleading exception traces appear in the lovely web browser. In short, it's fiddly and dirty. The clever people at Google have taken away the majority of this nastiness with GWT. It's very neat, and you only write code in Java to build the application. <br />
<br />
In this workshop, we will lead you into building web applications using GWT by walking through a simple example, and then allowing you and a partner to build a working AJAX web application. You will learn what we have found fits well in the GWT world, and discover that applications are extremely simple to put together. Finally we'll round up with a quick chat and attempt to answer any outstanding questions from the session.<br />
<br />
So if web apps are your thing, and you feel the pain too, this is for you.</td></tr>

<br />
During the workshop we will provide guidance and help as required. By the end of the workshop the participants will have built a working web application, have had some fun, and learned that GWT helps to make building rich web applications simple.</td></tr>
