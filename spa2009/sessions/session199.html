<br />
Complexity science is the study of complex systems, like ecosystems, biological systems, economic systems, etc. "Complexity science" is the scientific approach to "systems thinking". It can be used to understand and explain why complex systems behave the way they do. Ken Schwaber, Jim Highsmith and other experts have explained in their books that a lot of agile concepts have been copied from the study of complex systems. However, agile software development has not covered all there is to learn.<br />
<br />
I will show why practices must be agile (self-organized) *and* formal (controlled), why any software development method is doomed to fail, why managing scope is a too simplistic interpretation of the principle of “embracing change”, why most process improvement initiatives are linear and wrong, and why some sets of practices will be show chaotic behavior when combined.<br />
<br />
I will go a step further than what has already been described in mainstream literature, linking some of complexity theory with down-to-earth experience from the trenches in my role as chief information officer for a software development company.</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Benefits of participating:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">- Learn a new way of thinking, in terms of systems, agents and connections.<br />
- Learn how to see best practices in a new light, from a "complexity science" point-of-view.<br />
- Learn how to change process improvement initiatives.</td></tr>

- During the presentation the audience is asked to document their own opinion on these statements.<br />
- In the last part we will be tallying the results, to see which statements are most controversial.<br />
- Discussion with the audience about the findings.</td></tr>
