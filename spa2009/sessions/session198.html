	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Some teams struggle to get buy-in to use Agile methods such as Scrum, or experience difficulty implementing the approaches successfully.  This results in the teams being less effective than they could be, and can give a poor impression of the benefits of Agile development.  Kanban, Flow and Cadence (KFC) are three important Lean concepts which can be combined to generate a more pipeline-based approach to software development, as opposed to the more common timebox-based approaches used by more traditional Agile methods.  Using Kanban, Flow and Cadence can smooth transitions to Agile development, or further improve the productivity of existing Agile implementations.<br />
<br />
The presenter will describe his experiences implementing these ideas at Yahoo! and explain the concepts using examples, simulations and games, as well as facilitating group discussion.  To tie all the ideas together, the session will close with a large simulation and demonstration showing how a real Kanban system might work.<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Benefits of participating:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">An understanding of a different approach to Agile Software Development, along with some experience of how and why the might apply that with a team. Kanban is the mechanism which manages the workflow, Flow is the approach to maximising value and minimising waste, and Cadence is the means to ensuring reliability and commitment.</td></tr>

Discussions will be small break-out groups where participants can brainstorm how the ideas might be applied to their own environments.  Groups will present back their outcomes and ideas so that they can be captured for publishing on a blog or wiki.</td></tr>

The Agile 2008 session received extremely positive feedback and also demonstrated that a longer session would be valuable.</td></tr>
