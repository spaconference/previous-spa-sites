	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">The Web 2.0 trend to create Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) has brought fresh challenges to testers: web browsers were never designed as test execution environments, yet applications are expected to work in an increasingly diverse set of platforms (2008 saw the introduction of IE8, Firefox 3 and Google Chrome).<br />
<br />
Whilst unit testing remains an important tenet of XP and Agile, additional GUI based tests are always necessary to ensure that the application works at the “user story” level.  Such GUI tests are often perceived as expensive and slow, and the tools that automate them have been criticized for offering little more than a low-level instruction set.<br />
<br />
Through our case study that uses Selenium, we will show that by applying User Centric Design (UCD) as a test structure it is possible to write higher-level tests that can be understood and modified by a Business Analyst.<br />
<br />
Having created these tests, we will examine ways to maximize the return on investment by applying tests beyond validating functionality to include portability, performance, regression, resilience etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Note: we would be keen to explore ways of making this a more interactive session, perhaps including hands-on portions where the audience use some of our tools and techniques to test an RIA and also solicit feedback on others' experiences in this area.</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">We will use a web trading application as an example Rich Internet Application (technology similar to Gmail as it uses AJAX, JavaScript, DHTML) to illustrate what Selenium can do.<br />
<br />
We will first demonstrate where we started (our first test!) and contrast this with a more recent “UCD test” that has a straightforward anatomy that is meaningful to Business Analysts and can be drilled down to low-level Selenium instructions.<br />
<br />
The main section will be divided evenly between the following:<br />
<br />
Browser Mechanics – basic Selenium concepts to illustrate its use<br />
Test Authoring – basic UCD concepts and how they can be applied to Selenium<br />
Test Execution – ideas on how to run tests to get the most out of them<br />
<br />
Note: Though presented in a case study format, we would like to raise awareness of other technologies and practices that can solve similar problems.<br />
<br />
As the scope of the material is quite extensive, we would like to spin out more detailed discussion as BoF sessions.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, we could extend the session to 150 mins (or have a separate workshop 75 min session) to do more practical stuff - maybe an exercise using a basic Selenium script that logs in to Gmail and sends a message to the delegate, then repeat the exercise using UCD at a higher level of abstraction.<br />
