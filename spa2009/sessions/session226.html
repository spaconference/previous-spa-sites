	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">De Bono’s Six Thinking Hats technique is often praised for being highly effective for meetings and group work. This hands-on session will use it to generate fresh insights into what is cynicism, and why there appear to be so many cynics in IT, and what can we do about improving matters for the cynics and/or the industry?<br />
<br />
This is a workshop to give a large, unaligned, unrelated, group of people a new lateral-thinking technique for managing meetings and generating fresh ideas. Participants will learn sufficient Six Hats’ theory and then experience it hands-on. The workshop aims to give people comparative exposure around a very rich and stimulating topic that all are aware of in the industry, or will become exposed to as they gain more experience.<br />
<br />
The primary outcome of the session is new knowledge, new experience, and to take the very useful Six Hats technique further afield and use it as a tool at work for various purposes such as retrospectives, architectural decisions, problem analysis and solving.<br />
<br />
The secondary outcome focuses on the cynicism that could be undermining our daily experience at work, and blocking us from achieving far more for ourselves and for our clients or employers. The workshop will generate real new insights into the cause(s) of cynicism in the industry, the dangers of it and what can be done about it. These last three topic-specific insights could be taken further by myself and/or other interested people and eventually lead to other natural outcomes.</td></tr>
