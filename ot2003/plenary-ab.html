<h2>A Programmer's Best Friend - eXtreme Programming with a Robot Dog</h2>

In producing their affordable consumer robot, the AIBO, the Sony Corporation
have often emphasized its basic role as an autonomous pet and describe its
function mainly as an Entertainment Robot. Indeed, a paper from the Sony
Computer Science Labs in Paris entitled, <i>The role of uselessness in the
design of artificial pets</i> indicates further the direction that Sony research
is heading. However, while creating a framework for interfacing the AIBO to
the Dolphin Smalltalk programming system we have also stumbled across
potential future applications for "not-so-useless" autonomous robots.

 
<p>
In this talk we will introduce an interesting application for a "useful"
programmer's pet. Extreme Programming (XP) encourages, among other things, the
tenets of merciless Refactoring and Pair Programming. Our Dolphin Smalltalk
environment has built in refactoring tools together with a code mentoring
facility (based around SmallLint) that aims to aid programmers in dynamically
assessing the quality of their code. By attaching the AIBO as a "real world"
agent of the code mentoring system we have created an automated Pair
Programming partner for the lone programmer. While we walk through the code of
our robot framework you will see the AIBO offering critical advice on
potential bugs or poorly written classes.

 
<p>
While this "programmer's best friend" is not an altogether serious proposition
with the limitations of the current technology, one can see how such robotic
mentoring might become truly useful in the not too distant future. If nothing
else, we've found it can offer a certain amount of light relief for the
caffeine crazed programmer hell bent on bashing out just one more class before
midnight.

  Object Oriented Programming since he discovered the "Blue Book" back in 1984
  although, by his own admission, he didn't actually get to grips with the
  Smalltalk language until some ten years later. In 1994, Andy "saw the light"
  and became a key member of the team that designed and built Dolphin
  Smalltalk. He is now a "raving" Smalltalk evangelist and, therefore, not
  someone who should be engaged in conversation at parties!
