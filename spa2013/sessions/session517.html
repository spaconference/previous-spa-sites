	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Large-scale agile adoption poses many challenges to organisations. Early successes with small teams & tactical projects often stall when faced with the realities of applying new ways of working to strategic programmes of work; the A-players "get" agile quickly but the majority are often left trailing, with new agile practices inconsistently applied; new systems deliver the right stuff on time, but are they supportable within the existing application landscape? For agile to become "business as usual" or the de-facto approach for business/IT change initiatives, it is necessary to balance a number of aspects: scalable delivery, sustainable change, & supportable solutions.<br />
<br />
In this session Ian Spence, consultant, published author, and long-time agile evangelist, will explore some of these challenges and how they were overcome in various diverse organisations, including banking, insurance and telecoms.</td></tr>
