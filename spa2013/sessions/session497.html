	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">As a community, we are fascinated by software and IT and what we can achieve with it. That fascination inspires us to produce great things that make the world a better place. <br />
If current figures are anything to go by, however, we might be the last generation to be inspired this way: in the UK, while industry and society at large are crying out for our skills, fewer and fewer young people choose to study computing or are attracted to our profession. There has never been a better time to think about the sustainability of our profession and we shouldn’t leave it any later! <br />
<br />
In this session we’ll debate the Software and IT Professional DNA: the knowledge, the learning, the skills, the experiences, the dreams, the unsolved problems that are core to our profession, that inspired us and that should be passed on to inspire the next generation. We will have a panel of experts to share their experiences with us. <br />
With the industrial, academic and facilitation skills of Jenny, Lucia, Jon and Lucy, we want to have structured discussions with practitioners like you, to share your experience and aspirations, whether you are a novice or a veteran. <br />

If sufficient data are collected, a ‘crowdsourced’ article will be produced and freely disseminated, for instance, through a BCS periodical. Exchange of contact details will be possible for those wanting to get involved moving forward. </td></tr>
