	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">The 1966 Tom Stoppard play "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead" concerns the fate of two minor characters from Shakespeare's Hamlet. It examines a number of themes and motifs, including: <br />
- The Incomprehensibility of the World<br />
- The Difficulty of Making Meaningful Choices<br />
- The Relationship Between Life and the Stage<br />
- Sacred texts (Shakespeare’s Hamlet)<br />
- Gambling<br />
<br />
The premise of this workshop is that these themes have direct analogs in the world of software development:<br />
- Requirements, architecture<br />
- Priorities, constraints<br />
- Conway's law<br />
- Best practice, received wisdom<br />
- Estimates, planning, risk<br />
<br />
We will discuss these themes and how they are portrayed in the play. We will then re-stage selected sections of the text in the context of software development. By doing this, we will gain insights into why some seemingly simple challenges in software development prove hard to overcome. We may also be able to identify solutions from "real life" that can be applied to help our working practice.<br />
<br />
The delegates can re-stage their selected scene however they see fit, so laptops/cameras/animation software may all be useful.<br />

<br />
Audience need not know the play in detail, but it would be useful if they could have some idea what it is about. The play itself is less than 100 pages, and notes can be found online at http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/rosencrantz/</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Benefits of participating:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">I hope that by attending this workshop delegates will:<br />
- Have fun<br />
- Understand that many of the challenges experienced during software development are not unique to it<br />
- Gain insights that help them overcome problems at work (and in general)<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">We will describe the play and its themes. The themes will be discussed to ensure we have a common understanding.<br />
A breakdown of the key scenes will be presented, mapping a headline description with the themes explored in the scene. <br />
We split into groups. Each group will choose a scene from the play, and re-stage it in the context of a software development activity. <br />
Each group will decide what format their re-staging will be in: be live drama, slideshow, cartoon, computer program, or any other medium the group thinks appropriate.<br />
The groups will, in turn, present their work to all.<br />
Discussion & feedback.<br />
Ideally this workshop could take place on the first morning, giving groups time to refine their work over the rest of the conference, and present the output as an evening entertainment.</td></tr>

Coin flipping (Act One) - Why are we on this journey? What's happened to the laws of probability?<br />
The Players (Act One) - Who is the client? What are the requirements?<br />
At court (Act One) - Above your pay grade. What rules are we playing?<br />
Hamlet retrospective (Act Two) - How did that engagement go?<br />
Dress rehearsal (Act Two) - Death march by the book. Where did the real project go?<br />
At sea (Act Three) - Sealed orders. Shall we put off making any decision?<br />
The stowaways and the pirates (Act Three) - Was that on the risk register? Are we going to carry the can? Play acting again.<br />

We may distil some insights during the feedback/discussion during the workshop, which will then be written up and presented as a webpage.</td></tr>
