How to iterate efficiently over a set of objects? How to assign time-consuming tasks to workers in the best possible way? Often these problems are solved in ad hoc ways.<br />
<br />
A lot of these problems can be described as a constraint satisfaction problem. By recognizing a constraint satisfaction problem the opportunity arises to use constraint satisfaction solvers. This provides a uniform and battle-tested solution to common occurring problems.<br />
<br />
In this session we take a closer look into constraint satisfaction<br />
problems. These kind of problems are applicable in a wide range of<br />
contexts. Examples include schedule planning, frequency assignment to cell<br />
towers and work-flow optimization.<br />
<br />
After an introduction to constraint satisfaction problems, you will get<br />
the opportunity to try your hands on a few problems of your own. We<br />
even go the extra mile and implement a simple constraint satisfaction<br />
problem solver.<br />

<br />
* Acquire a powerful tool in you problem solving toolkit.<br />
* Be able to specify and solve constraint satisfaction problems.<br />
* Be able to implement a simple constraint satisfaction problem solver.<br />
* Acquire a practical set references for future investigations.<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">The session will start of with a practical introduction to constraint<br />
satisfaction problems. During the introduction examples of constraint<br />
satisfaction problems will be given and solved with a constraint<br />
satisfaction problem solver. <br />
<br />
After the introduction the participants can try their hands on<br />
specifying a constraint satisfaction problem of their own and solve<br />
them with a provided solver.<br />
<br />
After getting to know the constraint satisfaction problem paradigm,<br />
participants can test drive a custom implementation for a constraint<br />
satisfaction problem solver.<br />
<br />
There will be two types of exercises.<br />
<br />
1. Specific problems that can be solved by a constraint satisfaction<br />
   problem solver.<br />
2. A guided TDD session to implement a custom constraint satisfaction<br />
   problem solver.<br />
<br />
It is advisable to team up and pair-programming throughout the<br />
practical part of the session.<br />
