<br />
Pair-programming is one of the key practices in eXtreme Programming. While worshipped by some and booed by others, nice, sensible, politically-correct folks (that is, everyone in this field) will qualify Pair-Programming as "something useful, but not always."<br />
<br />
During this session, we will focus on these less happy moments – the “not-always” – where the coder would rather not pair-program, while by the most extraordinary coincidence s/he has been assigned the company of a teammate, forcing her/him to share both work- and thinkspace.<br />
<br />
<br />
OBJECTIVE<br />
<br />
By the means of a totally anti-educational playlet, we hope to act as droll-models and show how to effectively kill any virtuous dynamics that might spur from practicing Pair-Programming. And, by doing so, to help those in desperate need to claim back their peace and loneliness.<br />
<br />
(META-)OBJECTIVES<br />
<br />
* To promote Performative Programming as a format<br />
* To celebrate the act of programming<br />
* To do something not-so-usual in a conference, to shake things up a bit</td></tr>

* To learn how to get rid of one's team mates, without having to tell them to frock off<br />
* To learn how to drive one's agile coach nuts, without getting noticed<br />
* To imagine, guessing by elimination, how to improve one's own pair-programming sessions<br />
