	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">After 10 years of building large-scale enterprise systems for other people I decided to stop doing that to build a new SaaS business based entirely in 'The Cloud'. My company doesn't own a single server, doesn't have a data centre or a comms room, but provides a comprehensive SaaS product to a number of mid-tier investment banks and financial research houses by building entirely on platforms and services provided by force.com, heroku.com, Amazon and others.<br />
<br />
This session will cover the many new lessons learned, some forgotten lessons relearned and some old habits unlearned in the process of turning our product from a simple prototype built on force.com to a complex product built across a number of different platforms and services, used by our growing customer base. The focus will largely be on the technical aspects of what we've done but will provide the context of the operational and business advantages and limitations (approx. 70/20/10 split technical/operational/business).<br />
<br />
My objective in running this session is to remove some of the hype from 'The Cloud' and to start a dialogue between practitioners about a vital topic currently dominated by vested-interested vendors and a hype-driven media.<br />
