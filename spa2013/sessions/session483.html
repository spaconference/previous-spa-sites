This year we've gone one step further and created a Technical Academy to provide classroom based training, mentorship and guided learning for our apprentices. So far we think it has worked and we'd like to share how we did it.<br />
<br />
More importantly we'd like to get feedback on our approach, hear stories of similar initiatives and ultimately convince every attendee to go back to their company and hire an apprentice. We'll structure the discussion to include topics along the lines of experiences, reasons to hire an apprentice, potential problems, lessons learnt, curriculum ideas, recruitment, team dynamics, convincing your team and where to start.<br />
