	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">The objective of this session is to share my experiences of working on sites going from beta to live. I will primarily be focusing on the architectural changes that were needed and why. I will also explore the problems that brought and how some of them were overcome and others that just bit back.<br />
<br />
What does it mean to go from beta to live? I will outline the architecture of GOV.UK as it stood at the time of beta and the challenges that we faced changing the architecture while we were still developing new features on top of it. While a beta site contains 'just enough to get going' and live is 'for real', I will explain why even a live site still needs to contain a 'good enough for now' approach, which has serious benefits and some drawbacks. Benefits include hitting that launch deadline, ensuring that you don't over complicate for the future and how it encourages the importance of tests. The drawbacks are 'good enough' is a constantly assessed judgement call and I'll explore some of the trade offs that come with that. <br />
<br />
When doing architectural work it's important to communicate the changes to other developers but without maxing out their brain space causing them problems of the tasks at hand they are doing. I will discuss how we did this, what went well and what didn't. I'll also describe how we communicated to the rest of the department about the work we were doing and the challenges that brought. Demonstrating a new design is easy, demonstrating a new architecture to non developers is harder.<br />
<br />
GOV.UK is the third site I've worked on where the site has gone from beta to live. The end of my session will breifly outline the other projects I was a part of and in summary include a list of things I've learnt and a list of things I'd do better/differently next time. I will then leave some time at the end for questions.</td></tr>
