<br />
One option would be to keep a count of all the comments on discussions, or views on pictures. In most situations this would work great, but if in a single day you could expect millions of different pictures to be viewed, or thousands of different discussions to be conducted, you could start getting annoyed at all the data you're storing - after all, you only want the top 5 or 10, why store all the rest?!<br />
<br />
This is where probabilistic data structures come in. They aim to store the important data, and forget about the rest, and they result in rough rather than exact answers.<br />
<br />
We'll be looking at some of these data structures, and then giving them a whirl by implementing them, and hooking them up to some data streams, and seeing how good their answers are, and how much memory they're actually using up.<br />
<br />
Coding will be in Haskell.</td></tr>
