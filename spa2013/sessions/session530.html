	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">The conference circuit has been a-buzz lately with a lot of talk about ‘them’ and ‘us’.  ‘Them’ being the leaders of divisions and companies, and ‘us’ being the dev teams on the ground.  Presentations, papers and books explore and present a myriad of issues and solutions.<br />
<br />
But what is it really like to be a leader of a division when Agile/Lean is being/has been introduced to multiple teams?  What if we could just ask ‘them’ direct?<br />
<br />
This is the intention behind this session:  a panel formed of 3-4 top level management leaders of software engineering divisions and/or companies which have experienced steering multiple teams that are utilising Agile/Lean.<br />
<br />
The suggested format would be:  the panel members first briefly introduce their Agile/Lean experience and company/division and then, respond to a series of questions.<br />
<br />
Ideally, the leading questions would also contain those suggested and voted on by conference members prior to the panel session. Then discussion would be opened out to the floor.<br />
<br />
For the sake of example, the questions might take the form of:<br />
a)	What have been the biggest challenges of Agile/Lean teams, from a leadership perspective?<br />
b)	What is the main change you have found in your role since Agile/Lean was introduced?<br />
c)	What are the tradeoffs you see and/or have made because of Agile/Lean?<br />
d)	What are the top 3 pieces of advice you would give other leaders contemplating the move to Agile/Lean?<br />
e)	What do you need from your Agile/Lean teams the most?<br />
f)	Do you see a cultural divide between Agile/Lean and the business arena?  If so, what would you suggest / have done to rectify this?<br />
g)	What would you want that Agile/Lean doesn’t give you?<br />
h)	What do you need to see to get buy-in for an Agile/Lean initiative?<br />
