<p><strong>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are ... dead similar to software folk everywhere</strong> <br />
The 1966 Tom Stoppard play "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead" concerns the fate of two minor characters from Shakespeare's Hamlet. It examines a number of themes and motifs, including: The Incomprehensibility of the World, The Difficulty of Making Meaningful Choices, The Relationship Between Life and the Stage, Sacred texts (Shakespeareâ€™s Hamlet), Gambling.
<br/>
<br/>
The premise of this session is that these themes have direct analogs in the world of software development. We will discuss these themes and how they are portrayed in the play. We will then re-stage selected sections of the text in the context of software development. By doing this, we will gain insights into why some seemingly simple challenges in software development prove hard to overcome. The delegates can re-stage their selected scene however they see fit, so laptops/cameras/animation software may all be useful.
<br/><br/>
Audience need not know the play in detail, but it would be useful if they could have some idea what it is about. The play itself is less than 100 pages, and notes can be found online at http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/rosencrantz/

<td width="30%" valign="top">
<p><strong>Games Lounge</strong> <br />
This year we will have a games lounge alongside the evening diversions where people can talk, share a drink, generally socialise and, should the mood take them, play a board game...
<br/>
<br/>
...and to help with socialising there will be a subsidised bar courtesy of the sponsors.

<p><strong>Agile Trivia Quiz</strong><br/>
Agile approaches to software development are nothing new and this
diversion offers SPA participants the opportunity to have a bit of fun
demonstrating your wit and experience in this area.
In traditional pub-quiz style, we'll be forming teams with a variety of
experience to try their luck at different rounds of questions. There will
be a picture round where you'll be asked to determine what agile
techniques are being depicted, a History round where you can demonstrate
your knowledge of agile roots, plus a Tools round and of course a Trivia
round.
<br/><br/>
Don't worry if you don't have deep knowledge in some areas, marks may be
given for entertaining as well as correct answers. Come along to have a
bit of fun discussing Agile, you may improve your knowledge and even win a
prize!
