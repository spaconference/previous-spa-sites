<I>How can you tell how thorough your testing is? 
Coverage measurement can be used, but how in OO?</I>

<HR>
<PRE>In case you were wondering whether the 6 questions were true or false, this 
<P>is what I think:
<P>1 and 6 are false
<P>2 and 3 are true (even though they are contradictory)
<P>4 and 5 and not necessarily true - it depends on the test objective.

<P>Has anyone had any experience of using coverage measures in OO? </PRE><HR>
<PRE>Open distributed processing, together with component-based development, challenges all our traditional assumptions about software testing.
<P>
<P>The systems we (usually) want to use are open systems.  But we can only test closed systems.  A test is a controlled scientific experiment. A test must be repeatable. Scientists in
<P>laboratories invent controlled (repeatable) experiments that are believed to provide useful information about the uncontrolled
<P>(unrepeatable) world.
<P>
<P>Furthermore, the concept of testing coverage only makes sense within some fixed scope.  In other words, I need to draw some artificial boundary around the system I'm testing.
<P>
<P>For elaboration of this point, see http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~rxv/DIPQUE.htm
