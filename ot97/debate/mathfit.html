<PRE>Composing generic design frameworks
<P>===================================
<P>
<P>Partial views are necessary for both specifiers and designers.
<P>
<P>A specifier needs partial views because his system will have different users
<P>--- whether they are software users or real end users.
<P>
<P>Designers need partial views for much the same reason; but there's a mroe
<P>interesting way of looking at it.
<P>
<P>In my experience, the most useful foci of design are not so much the
<P>functional units (whether these are objects or subroutines
<P>or machines or data records or whatever) as the relationships between those units:
<P>how two objects interact (or how two subroutines use each other etc).
<P>These relationships, once worked out, can be used again and
<P>again in the work of design. 
<P>
<P>For example, the linked list idea is about how a series of 
<P>records or objects is connected and handled: and if you read
<P>a good textbook on program design, it will describe those
<P>aspects in detail. But what the book cannot say is what else
<P>will be in those records: that is up to you. The text gives
<P>a 'pattern' or generic framework which can be applied in 
<P>many cases, and can be used in combination with other such
<P>patterns or frameworks. For example, you might use each record
<P>to represent an object with several appearances on the users'
<P>screen, all of which keep up-to-date: a trick described 
<P>somewhere else in your textbook.
<P>
<P>So each framework describes the relationship between several objects;
<P>and in a given design, each object can play a role in 
<P>more than one framework. A design can be thought of as a 
<P>combination of frameworks, cemented together by objects
<P>that play roles in more than one.
<P>
<P>At present, this is just a way of looking at what we commonly
<P>do with design. There is no tool (so far as I know) that
<P>can mechanically combine frameworks in this way; and very
<P>few notations (apart from OORAM, perhaps)
<P>strong enough to express a framework -- which
<P>is a partial view of a design.
