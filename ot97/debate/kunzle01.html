<I>Distributing objects adds a further level of complexity into any application design. What areas really need to be thought about, what can be ignored, and when should these decisions be made.</I>

<HR>
<PRE>One issue is locality --- although you could claim this is
<P>just a performance issue.
<P>
<P>The obvious [being provocative!] starting point is the 
<P>structure of the company. Everyone has their machine on
<P>their desk, so objects used by a given person -- and the
<P>object representing that person and the role(s) they play ---
<P>should be located idelly within their machine. 
<P>Departmental objects are in the Department's machine --- 
<P>and so on. 
<P>
<P>(Does this make sense? Is it important?)
