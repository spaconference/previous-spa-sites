<H4><A HREF="Alan has disk" target=card>Design Pitfalls as Negative Patterns</A>
<!-- pickup --></H4>
<I>Many patterns can be expressed in negative form: avoid XYZ.  Experienced engineers have a personal set of negative patterns (or design pitfalls) that they search for when evaluating or testing other people’s designs.  Some of these negative patterns have a corresponding positive pattern: "avoid XYZ, do PQR instead".  If such patterns could be recognized by automated design tools, appropriate warnings and wizards could be provided.</I>

<HR>
<PRE>This isn't my field, but I thought all patterns contained a negative element,
<P>in that the pattern would discuss possible alternatives and point out
<P>why you should choose one over another. The rejected options are clearly
<P>negatives.
<P>
<P>> If such patterns could be recognized by automated design tools, appropriate
<P>> warnings and wizards could be provided.
<P>
<P>Is this for real? Do you really believe this kind of automation is
<P>possible?

<P>
<P>This is true.  But I haven't seen much focus on this negative element before.
<P>
<P>Two cases particularly interest me.
<P>
<P>1) When the negative element of the pattern is much stronger than the positive element.  
<P>This is true of many of Christopher Alexander's patterns, where the structures he dislikes are often expressed much more clearly and forcefully than the structures he recommends.
<P>
<P>2) When the designer is unaware of having used a pattern at all.
<P>The identification of negative patterns within an existing or proposed design becomes a powerful way of critiquing the design.
<P>
<P>John Daniels also writes:
<P>
<P>> Do you really believe this kind of automation is possible?
<P>
<P>Yes.  Many design tools (such as CASE tools) issue warnings to the designer when they detect certain simple structures.
<P>A design tool could, for example, detect loops in a complex software system that could result in runtime deadlocks.
<P>My conjecture (to be examined at the OT 97 workshop) is that there are many unexplored opportunities for building such facilities into design tools.
<P>
<P>Thanks for your interest, and I hope to see you in Oxford.
