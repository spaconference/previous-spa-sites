<h1>Design Pitfalls as Negative Patterns</h1>



<p>This page describes a workshop session that will be run as part of the

<a href="http://www.sis.port.ac.uk/bcs-oops/ot97/">Object Technology 97</a>

conference in Oxford, April 14-16 1997.</p>



<h2>Subject of Session </h2>



<p>Many patterns can be expressed in negative form: avoid XYZ. Experienced

engineers have a personal set of negative patterns (or design pitfalls)

that they search for when evaluating or testing other people's designs.

Some of these negative patterns have a corresponding positive pattern:

&quot;avoid XYZ, do PQR instead&quot;. If such patterns could be recognized

by automated design tools, appropriate warnings and wizards could be provided.

</p>



<p>The principle objective of the session is to evaluate the usefulness

of the concept of negative pattern. We will discuss some commonly occuring

negative patterns, and will discuss general ways (also patterns) in which

negative patterns in a given design may be identified and treated. This

discussion could continue afterwards by Internet, with a possible ultimate

goal of developing a repository of negative patterns and guidelines for

their use. </p>

<h2>Deliverables </h2>



<ol>

<li>Set of negative patterns, together with their positive correlates </li>



<li>Set of patterns for the use of negative patterns </li>
