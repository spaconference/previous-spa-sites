<H3>The Problem</H3>
<H6>John Cameron described this problem in his excellent talk at OT96.</A>
I am called upon to model a plumbing company, in preparation for designing
a job scheduling system. The essential requirements are that plumbers must
not be allocated to simultaneous jobs, and a suitably skilled plumber must
be allocated to each job. <BR>
As part of my specification of the system, I draw this model:<BR>
<IMG SRC="image3.gif" WIDTH="466" HEIGHT="248" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><BR>
The next job would be to go into the use-cases and decide what operations
the system must perform; and after that, to get into the design. But I feel
that in this model I've captured the essence of what the system is about,
and quite precisely too.<BR>
<BR>
Now suppose I get another piece of modelling work from a training company.
It has various lecture rooms, each with different installed facilities -
computers, whiteboards, soundproofing, etc. All their courses last one week,
and they need to ensure that lecture rooms aren't overbooked, and that each
course is allocated to a room that has the appropriate facilities. Of course,
I soon recognise that this is a very similar problem to the plumbers. A
quick solution is to cut and paste and relabel the boxes and lines.<BR>
<BR>
But I'd like the two models (plumbing and training) to be specialisations
of a single model. That way, if I later have any new insights about resource
allocation in general, they can automatically be adopted within the two
specific models.<BR>
<IMG SRC="image2.gif" WIDTH="497" HEIGHT="210" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><BR>
The questions are, 
<UL>
<LI>What's in the &quot;general model&quot; ?
<LI>What is the means by which it is specialised to form the particular
models?
</UL>
<H3>The Wrong Answer</H3>
My first bright idea is to make some superclasses:<BR>
<IMG SRC="image1.gif" WIDTH="409" HEIGHT="125" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><BR>
Then the specialisation is just a question of ignoring the classes I'm not
interested in for a particular application.<BR>
<BR>
But this ain't right. In this model, a training Room can be allocated to
a plumbing Job; and a Plumber could be expected to have an OHP.
<H3>The Right Answer</H3>
The general model should be (I contend) a<B> template or modelling </B>framework,
from which the specific models can be generated. Modelling frameworks make
very powerful re-usable design components.<P>
<A HREF="http://www.trireme.com/papers/50fworks/" target="_top">This paper</A> describes modelling frameworks and their use in more detail.<P>
<B>In the workshop,</B> we'll explore some of these ideas by trying out
several examples - bring your ideas too, please!<BR>
