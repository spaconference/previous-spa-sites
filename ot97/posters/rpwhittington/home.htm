There is much talk these days about business (or enterprise) objects.

Much interest derives from opportunities for greater system integration,

through re-use of larger-grained components. But the potential

benefits for business integration are no less significant. Object

technology can be used to create a business architecture that

delivers clear statements of purpose, responsibility and performance,

well-defined relationships, and resilience to change. The creation

and availability of such architectures significantly reduces risk

in development projects. Requirements models can be tightly linked

to organisational objectives, enabling exploration of alternative

implementations.

This tutorial will address the use of business objects in organisation

design, focusing upon the business benefits that can be achieved,

modelling techniques that can be used, and cultural issues relating

to the development process.

<H1><FONT COLOR=#0000FF FACE="Arial">Target Audience</FONT></H1>

<P>

Those who are keen to understand how business risk can be managed

through effective use of business object modelling, and how implementations

can be tightly linked to organisational objectives. This will

include: business analysts, project managers and business managers.

A general awareness of OO principles is assumed.

What is a business object? We will discuss the characteristics,

and differentiate from software objects. Briefly:

<UL>

<LI>Business objects represent business resources and capabilities.

Examples include Customer, Product, Order, Opportunity, Diary,

Delivery, Request, Complaint, StaffMember, &#133;

<LI>A business object integrates behaviour and data that the business

needs in order to fulfill its process responsibilities. So, for

example, a Customer object integrates the behaviour and data that

the business needs in order to acquire, engage and manage its

customers. 

<LI>This behaviour will be delivered in part by people, and in

part through technology (i.e., communications and information

systems). Business objects abstract away from implementation specifics.

It is often important to be able to encapsulate requirement at

a level that enables identification of implementation options,

including responsibility distribution across people and technology.

<LI>They are normally large-grained composites, comprising several

smaller objects. For example, a Customer object might contain

Address and PersonName objects, together with references to Account

and Diary objects.

<LI>Conceptually, business objects exhibit the same properties

as software objects. Inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism

all apply in much the same way. The benefits of inheritance and

polymorphism are very much in terms of consistency; and the benefits

of encapsulation are very much in terms of clear process responsibility

and management of change.

<LI>A business object architecture provides a framework for system

object design. A business object will typically give rise to a

number of system objects. Traceability of the system back to the

business brings significant benefits during change management.

</UL>

<P>

We will also briefly trace the history of object technology, from

its roots in system implementation through increased abstraction

and broader applicability. <BR>

<P>

What are the benefits of business objects? In particular, we will

focus upon:<BR>

<UL>

<LI><U>Business integration;</U> the ability to achieve consistency

of understanding and operation, within and between business processes.

This is especially crucial in the context of change management.

<LI><U>Understanding and communication</U> bridging the business

/ systems gap; the provision of notations and techniques that

can engage management, operations roles and systems developers

in a coherent debate. This applies during development and throughout

continuing improvement.

<LI><U>Business risk management;</U> integration and understanding

both contribute to management of risk, a multi-dimensional concept

that is ever-present during change. Looked at in this way, business

objects can be viewed as a risk management strategy.

</UL>

It is useful to explore concepts through examples. We will work

through a simplified case study, illustrating techniques for creation

and exploration of a business object model. The model will begin

with a high-level business requirement expressed in terms of goals

and process responsibilities. 

<P>

<P>

For example, the diagram above is an Object Association Model,

showing the business objects and services required by a specific

process activity. Although techniques like this are highly effective

at driving out well-focused object and service requirements, they

do not support architectural consolidation.<BR>

<P>

The following diagram is a Process Insight Model. For a broader

process capability, this consolidates the complete set of contributing

business objects and services. <BR>

Within the context of the example we will discuss repository management

requirements and opportunities.

Participants will share in a short session of practical modelling,

working in small teams. The precise nature of the practical work

will take account of the number and backgrounds of people involved.

The practical will wrap up with a short presentation and discussion.

We will review the business benefits in the light of the practical

examples.

Introducing business object modelling into the organisation development

process raises a number of cultural issues, including:<BR>

<UL>

<LI>Many business people are not familiar with object concepts,

nor even with the more general proposition of using (even semi-)formal

notations to express business requirements. To be most effective,

object approaches need to encourage active understanding and participation.

<LI>In many organisations, business people expect an involvement

at the beginning and end of a development project. To be most

effective, object approaches need to encourage wider and continual

participation by the business.

<LI>IT people can be defensive or arrogant when their methods

are exposed to the broader business. This can lead to resistance

against wider involvement of business people. To be most effective,

object approaches need to encourage developers to welcome a broader

cultural mix within development teams.

</UL>

<P>

We will review these and discuss ways to avoid potential resistance

and win wider acceptance from business and systems communities.
