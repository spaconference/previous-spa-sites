<H2>How thoroughly has your OO system been tested?</H2>
<FORM>
<UL>
<INPUT TYPE="radio" name="thorough" value=1> could have been better<BR>
<INPUT TYPE="radio" name="thorough" value=2> not bad<BR>
<INPUT TYPE="radio" name="thorough" value=3> quite good<BR>
<INPUT TYPE="radio" name="thorough" value=4> really superb<BR>

</UL>
</FORM>

<P>
<B>Which of these is the best answer?
</B>
<P>
None of them!

<P>
All of the above are just subjective opinions; 
<P>
in order to know about test thoroughness, we need objective facts.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Test coverage is a measure of test thoroughness? </B>
<P>
<B>Therefore does 100% coverage = 100% tested?<BR>
</B>
<FORM>
<UL>
<INPUT TYPE="checkbox" name="cover" value=1> it must be, as coverage is the only way to assess thoroughness<BR>
<INPUT TYPE="checkbox" name="cover" value=2> certainly not, you can never test everything<BR>
<INPUT TYPE="checkbox" name="cover" value=3> yes it is, but only in the coverage aspect being measured<BR>
<INPUT TYPE="checkbox" name="cover" value=4> 100% coverage must be better than a lower percentage<BR>
<INPUT TYPE="checkbox" name="cover" value=5> if you don't achieve coverage, you're not testing very well<BR>
<INPUT TYPE="checkbox" name="cover" value=6> coverage concepts don't apply to OO<BR>

</UL>
</FORM>
<P>
<B>What is thoroughness in testing?<BR>
</B>
<P>
Test Coverage works like this:
<UL>
<LI>First, count up the &quot;things&quot;. 
<LI>Then run the tests you have devised so far.
<LI>See whether your tests have exercised all of the &quot;things&quot;
you identified.
<LI>If not, devise more tests until you cover them all (or how
many you want to cover).<BR>

</UL>

<P>
In traditional development, there are commercial tools which can
measure the coverage of a number of different structural elements.
The most commonly used is branch coverage (e.g. True and False
outcome from IF) of code.<BR>

<P>
Even without tools, coverage concepts are extremely useful at
many different levels of testing. For example, have you tested
every requirement? Has every error message been seen? Has every
screen appeared in at least one test?<BR>

<P>
<B>What about measuring coverage for OO systems?</B>
<P>
The workshop will try to answer the following questions:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>what constructs are there in OO which could be enumerated?
<LI>is it possible to tell whether a test execution has used a
given construct?
<LI>what constructs should be covered for good testing?
<LI>where do bugs hide in OO systems?
<LI>are traditional coverage measures relevant or useful in OO?
<LI>do different OO languages need different coverage measures?
<LI>what experience in measuring the thoroughness of testing OO
systems? <BR>

</UL>
