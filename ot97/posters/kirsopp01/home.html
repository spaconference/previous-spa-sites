<HR><BR><H3><FONT COLOR="#0000B0">Target Audience</FONT></H3>
This BOF session is aimed at those conference attendees who would consider themselves as being at a beginner or intermediate level at object-oriented design. Some familiarity with OMT/UML would also be preferable</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#0000B0">Session Objectives</FONT></H3>
<UL>
<LI>To help less experienced OO designers improve their understanding of object-oriented design.
<LI>To show how heuristcis can be used to improve designs.
<LI>To discuss issues concerning the application of heuristics in practice.
</UL>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#0000B0">Structure of Session</FONT></H3>
The structure of the session will be based around a design assessment/revision case-study.  Attendees will be provided with: a 'base-line' set of heuristics; the case-study specification; and a first draft design solution to the case-study.  The group will then assess and revise the first draft design using the given set heuristics.  This process of design revision will be used as a catalyst for discussion of the wider issues of OO design heuristics.  The direction of the session will be led by the interests of the participants.</P>

Some possible areas of interest/discussion:
<UL>
<LI>The validity of the suggested heuristics
<LI>Suggestions for further heuristics
<LI>The generality/specificity of heurstics
<LI>The objectivity/subjectivity of heuristics
<LI>Trade-offs between heuristcis
<LI>The process of heuristic application
<LI>The position of heuristics within the software design process
</UL>
The session will conclude with a consideration of the state of practice and research in the area of OOD heuristics.  This will include: discussion of the existing literature; discussion of current practice in design assessment and the exent of the use of heuristcis; and suggestions for further work in the area.</P>
