Re-use is the lead reason for taking up OT, surveys show. But OT by itself
is just an enabler.<BR>
OT and re-use will reduce costs if well applied. If badly done, it <I>increases</I>
costs.<BR>
Costs always increase in the short term: much capital investment is required
to move to a re-use culture.

Unfortunately, requires: 
<UL>
<LI>Investment (i.e. initial expenditure) 
<LI>Specialised architectural skills 
<LI>Restructuring of project finance and workforce 
</UL>
<H2><A HREF="kent_wills03.html">Components need stricter specification</A></H2>
<UL>
<LI>Component-building is about plugging things together --- well-defined
interfaces required 
<LI>More restricted or no informal communication between suppliers and users
<LI>Components need tools need precise semantics

<UL>
<LI>Describe how each message affects state of object (and outputs)

<LI>The state-changing operations are specified in terms of the read-only

<H4>Consequences</H4>
<UL>
<LI>More investment in documentation 
<LI>more reliable re-use 
</UL>
<H2>Many components are not single objects or classes</H2>
If 'component' means a coherent piece of design effort, then what do we
expect to see in a component?<BR>
Objects, clusters of classes, updates to classes, models, designs, plans,
architectures, patterns, ....<BR>
Pure server objects can be described in isolation: stacks, widgets, databases
all accept requests from any kind of client, return the results, and expect
nothing inparticular of their clients.<BR>
But a very great deal of significant work is about relationships and collaborations
between objects. As evidence, see any book on patterns. To encapsulate these
pieces of design effort in a component, you have to say something about
each of the participating objects and the roles they play.
<H4>Frameworks</H4>
<A HREF="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/rood-bin/c/03Intro/50fworks/01fworks">Frameworks</A> are a convenient notational device which allows us to express
the combination required when several roles are imposed on one object. They
are used to describe collaborations and other packages of design.<BR>
Frameworks formalise the collaborations and other relationships at the core
of patterns. A pattern describes how to use a framework.<BR>
