Greetings,

I am hoping to attend OT 97 and would like to participate in your working
group.

I am working with a small team of engineers, developing object-oriented 
software for the oil industry.  Our first product 'Hedera' is a Basin-modelling
workbench for use in exploration and is coded in C++ using ObjectStore for
persistance.  We are presently involved in a cross-platform tool for the
production side of the oil industry, again using C++ as well as a cross-platform
development tool called Galaxy.  The database in this case is relational with
an POSC compliant object-oriented interface layer.  We have significant
experience
in developing object-libraries for graphics, motif, and domain specific 
science.  

As object-technology has as one of its major drives, software reuse, we
should be striving toward that goal.  At the end of the day the greatest
efficiency
gains are not obtained mearly by better coding practice (though that
helps) but by gearing up with the use of libraries and components.  To do
this, interfaces must be designed with the 'big picture' in mind rather than 
only the project at hand.  If not, productivity gains will reflect only
reuse local to the project at hand, rather than for subsequent projects or
even the projects of others outside the company.  Thus it is probably best
to consider opportunities to market components along with the final product:
e.g. the means may be part of the end.

Yours sincerely,
Jon Ferguson
