Re-use is one of the main reasons people take up OT. But, beyond using C++
etc, what else is required to get this benefit? What are the re-usable parts,
and how are they re-used? 
<H4>To participate, you must submit a short relevant working paper by 15
March.</H4>
You must also be prepared to take part in an electronic discussion during
the month 15 March -- 13 April.
