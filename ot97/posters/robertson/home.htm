<P>The purpose of requirements patterns is to communicate requirements

knowledge so that it can be reused. The most useful requirements patterns are

those that are easily mappable to the early work of the requirements analyst.

Use Cases/Events can be used early in a project to identify business related &quot;chunks&quot;

of work. Use Cases/Events are also a convenient tool for packaging and accessing

requirements patterns. This workshop explores how to use generic patterns to

specify the requirements for a specific use case/event.</P><IMG

<P>The potential of patterns was recognised by an architect, Christoper

Alexander, who defined a pattern language for building a living environment.

Object oriented designs have developed the idea of using patterns to define and

communicate solutions to design problems. Lately analysts and requirements

engineers have been exploring the potential of requirements patterns as a

vehicle for reusing requirements.  You can find more information on patterns at

the

<P>The objective is for the participants to:</P>

<UL>

<LI>specify requirements for the case study, by using use case/event patterns</LI>

<LI>explore the advantages and disadvantages of using requirements patterns

<P>The session will be run as a business game that simulates the definition of

detailed requirements for renting movies. 

</P>

<P>&#149; The Scenario

</P>

<P>The participants are asked to play the parts of both users and requirements

analysts by defining their requirements (both functional and non-functional) for

a movie rental system. The choice of subject is driven by the need for a system

with which everyone has had some experience. 

</P>

<P>&#149; The Business Simulation

</P>

<P>The business game simulates the idea of using requirements patterns to help

start a project. The game explores ideas like: use cases/events as a vehicle for

capturing requirements patterns, the composition of a requirements pattern, how

detailed/abstract should the pattern be, advantages and disadvantages of using

requirements patterns.  The participants will work in groups. The session is

divided into a number of work units. The session leader will introduce and

review each work unit and provide guidance during the workshop:

Robertson is a principal of

<A HREF="http://www.atlsysguild.com/">The Atlantic Systems Guild</A>. She is a

teacher and consultant specialising in modelling techniques for systems

development. Her courses on requirements, systems analysis, design and problem

solving are well known for their innovative workshops and business games.

Suzanne is currently developing techniques for reusing requirements and

assessing requirements specifications..</P>

<P>   Suzanne has worked in information technology and has had varied

experience as a programmer, analyst, designer and manager. Since 1978, she has

consulted, done research and taught in Europe, Australia, the Far East and the

United States. She specialises in helping organisations to adapt modern software

development techniques to fit specific projects.   </P>

<P>In 1983, the partnership of: Tom De Marco, Peter Hruschka, Tim Lister, Steve

McMenamin, John Palmer, James Robertson, and Suzanne Robertson founded the

Atlantic Systems Guild. The guild is a New York and London based think-tank,

researching system development techniques and producing many well respected

books and papers.  </P>

<P>Suzanne is co-author of Complete Systems Analysis: the Workbook, the

Textbook, the Answers (Dorset House, 1994), a two-volume text and case study

that teaches the craft of systems analysis using examples from personal

experience of working on a large project.  Suzanne studied Information

Processing at the New South Wales Institute of Technology, she is a member of

the IEEE, the Australian Computer Society and is on the committee of the British

Computer Society's Reuse Group.</P>
