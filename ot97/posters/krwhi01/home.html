</H2>

<P>
When we change programming language, we use the new language for
a time as if it were the old one. In the same way, when a move
to OO is made, there is a period during which existing assumptions
must be reassessed for relevance. At the end of this period, our
mindset has changed and we use the new paradigm without translating
between new and old concepts.
<P>
The objective of this tutorial is to make explicit some of the
transitions that are often made gradually over a period of time,
as the object-oriented paradigm is absorbed. We will discuss conceptual
differences between an object-oriented approach and traditional
approaches that are often not immediately obvious to people starting
to use OO.
<P>
The session will focus on language-independent issues, that are
of interest particularly at the analysis and design levels.
<H2><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Issues for Discussion</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
This session will address the following topics:
<OL>
<LI>How the use of OO requires us to rethink where we draw the
line between analysis and design, and what we mean by analysis
and by design.
<LI>OO uses a real-world analogy to structure systems. Objects,
we say, are like objects we find in the real world. This analogy
is the source of a number of pitfalls for the newcomer to OO.
Why, and what are these pitfalls?
<LI>Many of us have worked for years with data modelling techniques,
and are told, when we start working with OO, that we overemphasise
the importance of data in the definition of objects. Why? What
are the differences? Where do we need to adapt our ideas, and
where could the OO people learn a thing or two?
<LI>One area where existing data modelling knowledge comes into
conflict with OO results from the similarity between inheritance
and generalization/specialization. What are the differences? How
should we think about inheritance? Some of the issues will be
explored.
</OL>

<H2><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Discussion</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
There will be time for discussion after each topic has been presented.
Attendees are invited to:
<UL>
<LI>comment on agreements/disagreements with the point of view
presented
<LI>add points that have not been covered.
</UL>

<P>
At the end of the session, we will ask whether there are other
issues that cause major problems when transitioning to OO and
whether the difficulties of making the transition are overrated
or underrated.
<H2><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Attendees</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
Both beginners and more advanced practitioners will be welcome.

This session was previously advertised as a Goldfish Bowl session
but will in fact be run as a Tutorial.<HR>
