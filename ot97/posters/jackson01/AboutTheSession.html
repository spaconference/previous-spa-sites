How might different situations result in a focus on one  approach (e.g. domains, roles, or services) being beneficial.</FONT></OL><H3>Deliverables</H3><OL>  <LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Completion of the various views for the example.</FONT>  <LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Completion of successive decomposition of a subset of  views.</FONT>  <LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Illustration of how transformation will result in implementation.</FONT></OL><H3>Target Audience</H3><P><FONT SIZE=+1>This session is aimed at people who have had some experienceworking on an OO project, either as a developer, a designer, or an architect.It will hopefully have several people who have attempted to (either successfullyor unsuccessfully) establish an architecture for a new or existing system.There will also hopefully be a range of experience levels. This sessionshould provide, across experience levels, a better understanding of howto go about establishing an architecture and what various concepts thatare made use of when people do so.</FONT></BODY></HTML>
