Service-Based Architecture</H3><P><FONT SIZE=+1>Services describe the business processes or tasks thatwe need to accomplish. The service based architecture describes the systemfrom the point of view of the tasks that the system must perform in orderto help the business accomplish its requirements. The application controlswhich business function occurs when and it also controls the flow of controlbetween the tasks.</FONT></P><H3><A NAME="Roles"></A>2. Roles</H3><P><FONT SIZE=+1>The roles based approach to describing systems stressesthat there are entities that know how to do the work and that they cooperateto do it; they work together. It is only within the context of their containingrole model that the roles' characteristics and behavior make sense. In addition,roles are not considered in isolation; the role model provides the boundaryand roles within that boundary interact with each other. Their collaborationis feasible because they know about each other; any individual role doesnot accomplish all that it needs to - it relies on other roles for somethings.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>Encapsulation is preserved because the roles do not care<I>how</I> their collaborating roles do the work; only that a role is availablethat will do <I>what</I> the initiating role wants.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>Roles can describe the kinds of things that occur whendiscussing business concepts.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>Finally, roles provide recursive decomposition, becauseeach role can itself be a role model.</FONT></P><H3><A NAME="Domains"></A>3. Domains</H3><P><FONT SIZE=+1>Domains are &quot;... a set of object types together consitutinga coherent sub-system which can be meaningfully considered as a group.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;</FONT></BODY></HTML>
