Morgan. A corporate standard founded on service-based architecturealready existed, but this does not adequately address the object orientedviewpoint. By integrating Syntropy , and the OORAM approach we have puttogether a methodology for building a systems architecture.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>This new architecture brings together three different approachesto modeling systems: domains, roles, and services; these are detailedbelow.These approaches have in the past been described separately. By consideringthe concepts within these approaches as well as how they relate, a coherentarchitecture emerges which takes advantage of the three individual approaches,but also provides additional potential through their synthesis.</FONT></P><H3><FONT SIZE=+2>Objectives</FONT></H3><P><FONT SIZE=+1>The objective of the session is to provide the participantswith experience in establishing a distributed architecture by making useof various architectural principles and patterns.This will be accomplishedvia a case study from the financial industry. An additional goal is to illustratehow the combination of some powerful concepts results in an even more effectivearchitecture via their synergy.</FONT></P><H3><FONT SIZE=+2>Motivation</FONT></H3><UL>  <LI><FONT SIZE=+1>General</FONT>  <UL>    <LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Conceptualize the problem</FONT>    <LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Capture the &quot;right&quot; abstractions</FONT>    <LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Verify whether system does what it's supposed to</FONT>    <LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Achieve reuse</FONT>    <LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Quality software</FONT>    <LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Scalability</FONT>    <LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Extensibility</FONT>    <LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Achieve Distribution</FONT>  </UL>  <LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Project specific</FONT>  <UL>    <LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Modularization</FONT>    <LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Divide team and work</FONT>    <LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Facilitate communication</FONT>    <LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Promote understandability</FONT>    <LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Vision for system</FONT>  </UL>  <LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Establish Coherent Architecture</FONT>  <UL>    <LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Developers and project managers must know about architecture    and be able to converse about it</FONT>    <LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Way to discuss, describe, document the structure of the    system</FONT>    <LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Define interactions of elements</FONT>    <LI><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Roadmap&quot; of image</FONT>    <LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Draw boundaries around areas in system</FONT>  </UL>  <LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Architecture Goals</FONT>  <UL>    <LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Better meet business needs by showing where shortcomings    are in current system.</FONT>    <LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Allow application development to be done consistently    and coherently.</FONT>    <LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Define common language to discuss system and its architecture.</FONT>    <LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Enable distributed archtitecture to be implemented.</FONT>  </UL></UL></BODY></HTML>
