If you don't havea good architecture, you shouldn't proceed to build a software product.&quot;[Gacek94]</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The term software architecture has been defined inmany different ways by different people.&quot; [Gacek94]</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;...a structure composed of components, and rulescharacterizing the interaction of these components&quot; [Gacek94 referencing[Jones93]]</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;A software architecture should identify the majorrisks, costs and size involved of the product to be developed&quot; [Gacek94].</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;...the architecting stage acts as a bridge betweenrequirements analysis and software design...&quot; [Gacek94]</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Software architectures should clearly show the majordependencies between system constraints. This provides a consistency ofform, and partitions the complexity. The architecture should be used todefine the interfaces between components, and furthermore be consideredas a basis for software maintenance in order to prevent architectural erosionand drift.&quot; [Gacek94 referencing [Perry92]]</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;As systems grow in size and complexity, it becomesincreasingly important at the architecting stage to specify more than thetopological structure of the product.&quot; [Gacek94]</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Software architectures act as an integration mechanismfor assembling software reuse components&quot; [Gacek94].</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Architecture is concerned with the selection of architecturalelements, their interactions, and the constraints on those elements andtheir interactions necessary to provide a framework in which to satisfythe requirements and serve as a basis for the design.&quot; [Perry92]</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;A unifying or coherent form or structure&quot; [F.C.Mish Webster's New Ninth Collegiate Dictionary, Merriam Webster, Springfield,MA, 1983.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The primary focus in architecture is the identificationof important properties and relationships...&quot; [Perry92]</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;...although architectural structures may themselvesabstract away from details of the actual computations of the elements, thosestructures provide a natural framework for understanding broader system-levelconcerns, such as global rates of flow, patterns of communication, executioncontrol structure...&quot; [Shaw95]</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;...skeleton around which system properties can befleshed out...&quot; [Shaw95]</FONT></P><H3>References:</H3><P><FONT SIZE=+1>[Dyson] Paul Dyson and Bruce Anderson , &quot;Issues inSoftware Architecture&quot;.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>[Gacek94] Cristina Gacek, Ahmed Abd-Allah, Bradford Clark,Barry Boehm, <I>USC </I>Center for Software Engineering - &quot;FocusedWorkshop on Software Architectures: Issue Paper&quot;, April 1994.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>[Gacek95] Cristina Gacek, Ahmed Abd-Allah, Bradford Clark,Barry Boehm, <I>USC </I>Center for Software Engineering - &quot;On the Definitionof Software System Architecture&quot;, April 1995.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>[Jones93] A.K.
