<H1>Architecture, Infrastructure, Framework - What's in a word?
</H1>

<H4>A think-tank at Object Technology 97</H4>

<H5>Organiser: John Daniels, Object Designers Limited </H5>

<P>
<B>architecture </B><I>n.</I> art or science of building; thing
built, structure; style of building; construction
<P>
<B>infrastructure</B> <I>n.</I> subordinate parts of an undertaking,
esp. permanent installations as basis for military etc. operations
<P>
<B>framework</B> <I>n.</I> frame, structure, upon or into which
casing contents can be put (lit. or fig.)

It's very fashionable in object-technology circles to draw comparisons
between the activities of writing software and constructing buildings.
The word 'architecture' crops up very often in writings and presentations
on object-oriented systems but the exact relationship between
software design and the activities I ascribe to building architects
is not obvious - not to me, at least.
<P>
The objective of this think-tank is to agree definitions of the
three words shown above, in the context of designing and building
object-oriented systems. In the course of doing that I expect
considerable insight into the activities of software design, the
use of object technology, and the allocation of duties to team
members.
<P>
Questions I expect to arise include:
<UL>
<LI>How do I know whether I have 'an architecture'?
<LI>How do I communicate an architecture to others?
<LI>What's the difference between an architecture and an infrastructure?
<LI>What's the difference between an infrastructure and a framework?
<LI>What's the difference between an architecture and a pattern
language!?
</UL>

<P>
The think-tank will produce three posters, each containing an
agreed definition of one of the above words (plus, probably, a
commentary on the appropriate interpretation of the definition).
<P>
<B>Who should come?</B> 
<P>
I envisage that the think-tank will comprise people who routinely
use these words in their work! These are likely to be system designers,
system builders and - errmm - system architects.
