<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE>Tom de Marco has suggested that there is no "softwarecrisis" - rather the real crisis is in estimation. We rarely get it right
and even if we could deliver an accurate estimate no-one would believe us.
The ODeT OO estimation tool embraces a process that seems able to master
some of these difficulties. The ODeT process will be used in the workshop
as a framework for discussion of the key issues in the effective estimation
of OO projects.

<H3>Benefits</H3>Delegates will leave the workshop with a better appreciation ofthe factors that need to be juggled when planning OO projects. It is
intended that delegates should share their own insights based upon
practical experience. A paper summarising the key points for debate will be
provided prior to the session. Additional material will be provided during
the session and conclusions will be made available as a  poster.
