<blockquote>This workshop aims to pool the best experiences and identify
the best practices in object-oriented development, using the UML notations.
We shall be on the look-out for: alternative techniques that support the
construction of particular models, the effect of developing models in different
orders, the degree to which models are independent or support each other,
helpful restrictions or alterations to the semantics of UML models, techniques
which are mutually compatible or incompatible, and counter-examples which
have been known to confuse developers! The goal is to identify and agree
upon sets of compatible techniques and models that might constitute a realistic
OO development process.

<td WIDTH="75%">Tony Simons was born in Leicester and educated at the Wyggeston
Grammar School and
<a href="http://www.emma.cam.ac.uk">Emmanuel College</a>,
<a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk">Cambridge</a>.
In 1985 he was appointed as a Research Assistant, and from 1988 as Lecturer
in Computer Science at the
<a href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/">University
of Sheffield</a>,
<a href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/">Department of Computer
Science</a>, where he is now Head of Teaching. He has taught Smalltalk,
Eiffel and C++, analysis and design methods and artificial intelligence
courses.
<p>His early research work in the
<a href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/research/groups/spandh/">Speech
and Hearing Research Group</a> focused on object-oriented models of speech
events and low-level phonetic decoding, with a certain amount of AI. Increasingly
drawn to object-oriented languages themselves, he completed a PhD in
<a href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~ajhs/research/thesisabs.ps">object-oriented
type theory and language design</a>. Currently a member of the
<a href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/research/groups/vt/">Verification
and Testing Research Group</a>, his research interests include object-oriented
languages, analysis and design methods, type theory, verification and testing.
<p>Tony has presented tutorials and workshops previously at
<a href="http://www.ecoop.org/">ECOOP</a>
'93, '97 and '98; at
<a href="http://www.acm.org/sigplan/oopsla/">OOPSLA</a>
'93 and '94 and <a href="http://www.ot2000.org/">OT</a> '98 in the areas
of object-oriented theory and analysis and design methods. He has presented
technical papers at numerous conferences including <a href="http://www.acm.org/sigplan/oopsla/">OOPSLA</a>,
<a href="http://www.ecoop.org/">ECOOP</a> and
<a href="../../../../../C%7C/Documents/www.trireme.com/www.ot2000.org/proposals/submissions/www.tools.com/">TOOLS</a>
and was a member of the OOPSLA '95 programme committee. He is a member
of the
<a href="../../../../../C%7C/Documents/www.trireme.com/www.ot2000.org/proposals/submissions/www.open.org.au/">OPEN
Consortium</a>, subject editor for
<a href="http://www.dcs.kcl.ac.uk/OOS/">Object-Oriented
Systems</a> and a contributor to the pUML group. Tony is the chief architect
behind the
<a href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~ajhs/discovery.html">Discovery

<h3>
Topics</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Goals of different stages of object-oriented development</li>

<li>
Definition and description of techniques and models</li>

<li>
Capturing and recording requirements and system events</li>

<li>
Identifying and distributing system behaviour over objects</li>

<li>
Transforming designs to create decoupled subsystems</li>

<li>
Conversion of design documents into code and test suites</li>

<li>
Model bias: supporting and conflicting perspectives</li>

<li>
Sequencing: making one technique build upon another</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;</ul>

<h3>
Benefits</h3>
Participants will learn to step back from UML modelling and consider why
different activities are carried out at different stages of the OO lifecycle.
By appreciating these goals, they will be better able to identify and select
a sequence of self-supporting techniques and models to build their own
development process.

<td><b>Audience:</b>
<p>Participants should be familiar with the UML notations and have some
personal experience of what works and what does not work for them in object-oriented
development, in order to contribute. Familiarity with event-driven, data-driven
and responsibility-driven design approaches will help inform the debate
and discussion.</td>

<h4>
Material</h4>
The documentation will summarise the premises of the workshop, outlining
the goals of OOAD (assuming a medium-sized IS project). The materials will
include thumbnail descriptions of the UML models and the different stages
where they might be appropriate; thumbnail descriptions of different techniques
for requirements capture, analysis, design, coding and testing, leaving
space for variant models and new techniques.
<h4>
Delivery</h4>
The workshop will produce a flowchart showing the preferred development
path(s) chosen by the participants, indicating techniques (processes) and
deliverables (data) and how these depend on each other. The workshop leader
will write up any particularly striking insights regarding the compatibility
of different techniques and models and distribute this via the web after
the conference.
<h4>
Format</h4>
The style will be brief introductory presentations from the front, followed
by extended round-table discussions in up to 6 teams of 6 people each,
concluding with sessions reporting back to the whole workshop, opening
up the discussion.
<h4>
Structure</h4>

<p><br>Note:&nbsp; Tony Simons would like to solicit the participation
of
<br>Alan Cameron Wills as a second leader in this workshop.&nbsp; At the
<br>time of submission, this had not been finally decided.
<p>The participants will be divided into a number of groups (up to 6
<br>teams of 6 members) tasked with identifying best practice and
<br>pitfalls encountered during OO development.&nbsp; They will be supplied
<br>with thumbnail descriptions of techniques and models, to which they
<br>may add their own.
<p>The first 90 minutes (up to the break) will be devoted to techniques
<br>and models for requirements capture, object identification, data
<br>and event modelling.&nbsp; This breaks down into:&nbsp; 15 mins for
the leader
<br>to present the main concepts of:&nbsp; goals, models, techniques;&nbsp;
50 mins
<br>for groups to focus on a particular sub-area;&nbsp; 25 mins for the
groups
<br>to report back and present findings.
<p>The second 90 minutes (after the break) will be devoted to techniques
<br>and models for system-level design, coding and testing.&nbsp; This
breaks
<br>down into:&nbsp; 15 mins for the leader to present the main concepts
of:
<br>goals, models, techniques;&nbsp; 40 mins for groups to focus on a particular
<br>sub-area and 20 minutes for the groups to report back and present
<br>findings.&nbsp; The final 15 minutes will be spent attempting to synthesize
<br>a process from the different identified development paths.
<p>The groups will be tasked to different topics, depending on the size
<br>of the attendance, and motivated to solve particular problems, of
<br>which the following are exemplars:
<p>Are interviews better than workshops for controlling requirements
<br>capture?&nbsp; Are activity diagrams better than use cases for modelling
<br>business logic?&nbsp; How does traditional ERM-style data modelling
fit
<br>with behaviour-centred object modelling?&nbsp; How can state models
and
<br>data models be related?&nbsp; Is OOD an elaborational or transformational
<br>activity?&nbsp; What kinds of model are needed to support distribution
<br>of behaviours and reorganisation of subsystems?&nbsp; On what basis
are
<br>subsystems identified and separated?&nbsp; How far can we expect to
<br>automate coding from design documents?&nbsp; Where does planning for
<br>testing fit into the process?
