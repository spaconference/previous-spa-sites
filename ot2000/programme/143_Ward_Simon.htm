<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE>                        The selection of Java for use on a project
                        immediately presents the development team
                        with more architectural decisions than
                        maybe any other technology.
                        
                        Applets, servlets or application? RMI or 
                        CORBA? Beans? EJBs? It's a growing list.
                        How do you balance the often conflicting
                        demands of the users, their managers and
                        the corporate IT Strategists when making
                        the architectural decisions? Will the
                        forthcoming J2EE Application Programming
                        Manual from Sun help to ease the
                        situation by providing a solution for
                        every problem?
                        
                        The workshop will explore the various
                        architectural options and consider the 
                        trade-offs that are made when making a
                        decision. It will also demonstrate that
                        just when you think you've got it right
                        there's always someone willing to come
                        along and put a spanner in the works.
<P>
                        A 'real life' project (due for delivery in
                        March 2000) will provide the basis of the
                        workshop. Participants will be formed into
                        teams and vie with each other to produce
                        the most flexible and resilient Java
                        architecture in the face of ever more
                        demanding requirements. At the end of each
                        iteration of the project each teams
                        proposals will be reviewed and discussed
                        by the group.
<P>
                        While covering all aspects of Java
                        architecture the workshop will place an
                        emphasis on multi-tiered architectures
                        and making enterprise systems available to
                        users who have no fixed office
                        accommodation.
<P>
                        Nomad: a member of a people who have no
                        fixed residence but move from place to
                        place... within a well-defined territory.
<P>
                        Shaman: a priest or priestess who uses
                        magic for the purpose of... controlling
                        events.
<P>
                        Soothsayer: a person who predicts the
                        future by magical, intuitive, or more
                        rational means.

        Simon Ward is a Lead Architect working for BT's
        Information Systems Engineering Division in Cardiff. He's 
        spent more years developing software systems than he'd
        care to admit to in public. He's been working with
        OO systems since 1996, initially with C++ and latterly
        with Java.
       
        He's interested in distributed component-based systems
        and the problems of providing universal access to
        enterprise systems for all users regardless of their 
        location or their means of access.
        
        He's also interested in the role that an Architect plays
        within a development team and how they need to balance the
        conflicting demands on the architecture from various
        sections of the corporate community.
