	Aidan has been a risk management consultant with Antelope since
 	1995. Prior to that he was a software engineering management
 	consultant with Coherent Technology, after an early career as a
 	research consultant in seismic geophysics.
<P>
	 Aidan developed Antelope's Scimitar Risk Management System to
 	 allow clients to achieve business objectives in the presence of
 	 risk. Unlike most risk management approaches, Scimitar deals with
 	 the responsiveness of the organisation and its management system
 	 rather than trying to quantify the detailed risks.
<P>
	 Aidan has led risk programmes to board level with organisations
 	 including Tesco, BT MNS, Lloyds of London, Norwich Union
 	 Healthcare and Willis Corroon.
