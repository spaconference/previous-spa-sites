<blockquote>The complexities of software development are being increasingly
acknowledged. Furthermore, the need for increasingly sophisticated end-to-end
process automation, requires a further increase in capability. This session
will review current thinking and consider newer approaches to software
development, with a particular focus on organisational and cultural issues,
presented by CBD, eCommerce, Customer-centric organisations and Integrated
Enterprise Architectures.
