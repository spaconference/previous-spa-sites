<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE><P>
Requirements capture is about getting as accurate a picture of possible
of what the users want, before investing overmuch effort in design.
Despite RAD techniques, there can still be a substantial delay between
requirement and first delivery; and despite joint application development, 
it's still possible for substantial questions about exactly what the 
software should do to turn up unpleasantly late in the development process.
<P>
This workshop will explore techniques for exposing gaps and inconsistencies
in requirements models, using high-precision UML to throw up important
questions about requirements, that might otherwise have been glossed over
or understood differently by all concerned.
<P>
Many texts on UML say little about how the different diagrams should 
cohere with each other. In this workshop, we will exercise a requirements
analysis cycle in which cross-checks between the different parts of a model
tell you when your requirements are consistent and inclusive.
<P>
This process, developed as part of the Catalysis method, has proved very 
effective in a variety of fields.
