David,

I'm not sure who to send this updated version to to get it on the web 
site.
I'm sending it to you, but let me know if I should send it to someone 
else!

Thanks,

Laura

<BLOCKQUOTE>The internet has significantly changed the nature of the way
today's companies do their business, and in doing so, has also impacted
the way systems need to be created, deployed and maintained. Customers
are demanding personalized information at a moment's notice; business are
looking to outsourcing and partnering to reduce costs; and intense 
competition
is demanding that whatever is developed, it better be done at "netspeed".

<P>The tools market is valiently trying to address these new requirements,
but has it truly addressed these notable shifts in the development 
paradigm?&nbsp;
In this think tank, we will examine the requirements for our brave new
world and assess how well the tool vendors are meeting them. As a bonus,
attendees are encouraged to take these ideas to their new startups and
make a fortune!</BLOCKQUOTE>

Participants will leave the think tank with a better understanding 
of&nbsp;
how development in the new world of the web differs from traditional 
development
both in terms of content, delivery mechanism and development process. It
will help clarify their thinking on both how to utilize existing tools
and what kinds of new tools they should be looking for.
