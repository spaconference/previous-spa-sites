<blockquote>One of the major challenges in Computer Science is the management
of big and complex systems, especially when those systems have to be developed
in an environment which is not clearly defined and in constant evolution.
The goals have been the same almost since the beginning of the computer
history. That is to have a system which is flexible and robust, feature
rich and controllable, simple and scaleable. All those qualities seem to
be contradictory and still highly desirable. The latest trend to try and
achieve those goals is component oriented development. This workshop is
focusing on this manageability issue and is trying to give an answer to
if and how this issue can be solved.</blockquote>

architect for a new Belgian start-up company 'Foundation Technologies',
specialised in Enterprise computing systems. His main point of interest
is everything what is related to enterprise architectures and componentisation
efforts in an open platform environment. He has build up his experience
working for approx 8 years with different ISP's and Vendors like PowerSoft
and Sybase. He can be contacted at Raoul.Dorissen@foundtech.be.
<p>Sebastien Effinier is a colleague of Raoul Dorissen, working in the

Many of his interests are the same, that is enterprise architectures, componentisation
and open platforms, although he is more theoritical, having a Mathematical
background. He has build up his experience working for approx 6 years with
different ISP's and Vendors like PowerSoft and Sybase. He can be contacted

<h3>
Topics</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Location transparency: not only be able to go connect transparently to
a local object or a remote object but also be able to switch from Corba
to RMI or any other distributed architecture, or from one transaction server
to another</li>

<li>
Design patterns: how the combination of well known design patterns gives
much more than each pattern individually</li>

<li>
Pluggable behavior: how behaviours such as implicit transaction propagation,
security handling or debugging and profiling can be added to an application
without any change to the code</li>

<li>
Components uncoupling: real component uncoupling is still rare today, why
is it so and how to overcome that</li>

<li>
View oriented development: how the user could at runtime decide which functionalities
should be part of his application</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</ul>

<h3>
Benefits</h3>
The participant will learn how to set up a robust Enterprise architecture
which will cover 100% componentisation, complete location transparency,
zero-cost pluggable behaviour, view oriented design principles, etc ...

<h4>
Delivery</h4>
Participants will be asked to form small groups and will be offered to

<h4>

presentation Part2; Lecture; workgroup : Round-table discussion followed

<h4>
Structure</h4>
Part 1 ( ~60')
<p>The session will start with pointing out the following problem statement;
<p>"Bubbles Company" is organised as a set of loosely coupled departments.
Each department has its own computer infrastructure and databases. "Documentation
Department" is in charge of feeding other departments with relevant, useful
and fresh information. Its members gather and compile all sorts of papers
and books. For each interesting piece of info they enter a kind of "summary
card" into a central database. This card contains all the usual bits of
information: title, authors, date of publication, abstract etc. In addition,
the card is associated with a set of "domains of interest". There is a
predefined list of such domains. Each department has the opportunity to
subscribe to one or more domains. When a card is entered in the central
database all departments that subscribed for at least one of the domains
associated with the card are informed about it. A subset of the card content
is entered in the departments' databases. It is highly desirable that all
involved departments are advertised or none.
<p>In line with its own organisational structure "Bubbles Company" Favours
that the application should be 100% componentised and able to run either
in a client-server and/or in an distributed n-tier architecture (without
knowing or choosing for a particular middleware architecture) and this
without needing to modify code nor to make any compromises towards the
chosen deployment context. Furthermore they would like to evolve to a view
oriented design paradigm enabling to reuse individual views in total different
business contexts.
<p>Participants will be asked to form small groups and will be offered
to solve one or more of the described hereafter problems.
<p>1. Describe the different components and their functionality (interface)
and place each component into the tier they best fit in. 2. Propose a solution
to enforce 100% componentisation throughout the different functional layers
of the application. 3. Propose a solution to enable 100% view reusability.
4. Propose a solution to achieve a complete location transparant architecture.
5. Propose a solution to enable the application to run either in a client/server
or in an n-tier context with changing a minimum amount of code and/or makina
minimum amount of conceptual sacrifices. 6. Foresee a strategy to achieve
pluggable behavior. 7. Foresee a controllability strategy
<p>At the end of this part each group should produce a poster Describing
its solution and present it to the group.
<p>Part 2 (~50 min)
<p>The above scenario will be altered. Each group will be asked to Deal
with a different alteration.
<p>Here are the altered scenarios: _ The browser, and pure html is preferred
for the data entry part _ The CORBA infrastructure changes (new provider,
new version) _ COM+ is chosen instead of CORBA _ Some departments move
from DBMS to ODBMS _ The structure some departments' database changes drastically
<p>Groups are asked to examine the impact of these changes: _ Which components
are affected and how _ Which components, if any, must move where and why
_ Which communication channels are affected and how _ Estimate the "cost"
of the proposed changes
<p>Again each group will be asked to present its solution on a poster.
Suggestions from other groups might be discussed briefly (timing dependant)
<p>Part 3 (~50 min)
<p>A <a href="proposedsolution.pdf">B2B based solution</a> will be presented
(slides). Key features of B2B and their advantages (compared to the proposed
solutions) will be highlighted in the course of the presentation.
<p>_ Use of MVC model (scenarios 1 and 4) _ Use of connectors (scenarios
2 and 3) _ Use of XML for metadata and view description (scenarios 4 and
5) _ Transaction handling (all)
<p>Other advantages, not illustrated by the exercise, will be mentioned
(testability, extendibility, etc.)
<p>Participants interested in a more in depth investigation of B2B will
be offered a BOF either handling the B2BFoundation Component and/or the
B2BFoundation Component library.
