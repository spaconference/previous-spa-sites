Feature-Driven Development is a software development process defined 
for ambitious projects which must deliver benefits to customers quickly. It 
uses techniques found in many other processes such as timeboxing, evolutionary 
delivery, relentless regression testing, specification by negotiation and risk/benefit 
analysis. It is distinguished by a simple succinct definition with a minimum "overhead".
The workshop takes the form of a game which adds an element of fun and competition to 
the serious business of managing software projects.

Andy Carmichael is a director and leading software engineering consultant
with Object UK Ltd specialising in object-oriented techniques for business
analysis and system design. As a leading advocate of the use of 
object-oriented methods, he has been involved with the specification and provision of
object-oriented tools, and with the definition of the methods themselves,
over many years. He is a regular speaker on object technology, CASE, and
software development, is the editor of two books published by Cambridge
University Press "Object Development Methods" and "Developing Business
Objects", and is on the editorial board of the periodical "Application

<H3>Benefits</H3><P>
The game will introduce the principles of FDD and allow players to try
key parts of the process in practice. The workshop 
is designed to stimulate discussion and comparison of the process 
with others that attendees may have used.

<B>Audience:</B> <P>
Useful to anyone interested in software development processes from both the 
planning/management viewpoint and modelling/development. 
There are no specific prerequisites and it is hoped that
both those with a management bias and those primarily interested 
in technical aspects of development will participate.

<H4>Material</H4>
<P>
The material for the conference documentation will be an explanatory paper
and slides to introduce FDD and the workshop. In addition a significant amount 
of project documentation will be produced for the workshop participants which
will be available to them on the workstations as on-line documents, printed material
and models in the CASE tools.
<P>
		
		
		

<H4>Delivery</H4>
<P>
Each group will produce a prioritised Features List for iteration 1.
Receive feedback from the system about progress in the first timebox and replan for iteration 2.
Finally a scoring system will be applied to judge the most effective team. The score is to
add fun and an element of competition to the worshop - as it will be based at least in part
on unpredictable aspects (how the fictional project progresses with the different features and unexpected events)
it will be as much a game of chance as skill and should therefore neither inflate the 
egos of the winners nor deflate the losers! It is based on the premise that we learn most when enjoying ourselves.
<P>
		
		

<H4>Format</H4>
<P>
The format is a mixture of short presentations, workshop and interactive game (the rules of 
which may be changed by the presenters at any time!).
