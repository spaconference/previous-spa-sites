The experiences of developing a large, commercial-strength system combining three 
paradigms - object, component and rule based development. Did this enable the selection 
of the best points of each or just produce a confused development?
<P>
A description of the benefits enjoyed and the problems encountered from this mixture 
of paradigms.
<P>
An exploration of solutions to some of the problems encountered. Inviting solutions from 
the participants and comparing them with the solutions attempted in the development.

I am an I.T. Consultant specializing in the development of object-oriented and 
component-based systems. My background is in underwriting and systems development 
for a major composite insurer. I have been involved in object-oriented systems 
development for five years and component-based systems for two years. My main 
projects over the last two years have been the development of a systems authoring 
tool and methodology and the implementation of a system using that tool.

The audience can share the experiences of a commercial development spread across paradigms,
seeing both the benefits and conflicts this gave. The session will explore real-life 
problems and draw solutions from the knowledge and experience of all the participants.
