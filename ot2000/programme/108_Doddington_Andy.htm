<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE>		You do not need to be the most perceptive of people to
		realise that XML and its siblings are somewhat flavour of
		the month at the moment. However, most examples consider
		relatively small-scale examples in which the issue of
		persistence barely exists - in most cases it is simply
                assumed that the XML will be held in a simple flat file.
		<P>
		By contrast, this case study describes a framework that
		was developed to allow large volumes of XML to be saved
                to a relational database, in such a way that the virtues of
		both technologies are retained. These include flexibility,
                simplicity and extensibility on the XML side, whilst
                benefitting from the ubiquity, reliability and performance
                aspects of relational databases. A further significant
                benefit of the approach is that it allows ad hoc queries
                to be performed on the persisted XML data, using standard
                SQL queries.

</TD><TD width=75%>	In an age in which a person is considered experienced after two
        years and an expert after three, it is almost embarassing to admit
        to having been in this industry for over twenty years. Although I
        started off in the area of image processing, I spent most of this
        time in the areas of SCADA, data logging and signal analysis - which
        are actually more fun than they sound. I also enjoyed the dubious
        pleasure of a few years in project management - before realising
        that my outlook was more <I>Dilbert</I> than '<I>Pointy-Head</I>'.
        <P>
        My interest and belief in OO dates back around seven years, during
        which time I have seen it evolve from being a rather revolutionary
        idea which was highly likely to provoke Fear Uncertainty and Doubt,
        to effectively being part of the mainstream of software development - at least in the areas in which I am now involved.
        <P>
        For the past five years or so I have been working in the banking
        industry, due in part to the large number of charming and intelligent
        people that exist in this area - oh, and the money helps too. The
        last three years have been spent working for an investment bank,
        helping with the development of a new Swaps Trading System. This
        project was able to demonstrate many of the benefits of OO, including
        being one of the most enjoyable projects that I have worked on!

<H3>Benefits</H3>		Naturally, I would be pleased to see the described approach
                being re-used, since I believe that it solves a problem that
                is likely to become more of an issue as the use of XML
                increases - which certainly appears to be the case at the
                moment.
		<P>
		However, my main motive is to demonstrate how the virtues of
                XML can be used to allow the development of more flexible
                solutions than those based on traditional hard-wired data
                structures. In an age in which the cost of software continues
                to spiral ever-upward, I believe that the idea of built-in
                flexibility is one of the most powerful weapons that we
                have at our disposal and one that is greatly enhanced by
                the use of XML.
