<blockquote>The outsourcing of application operations to an application
service provider is attractive for several reasons. It frees up IT (Information
Technology) resources for more important tasks and allows focus on core
competencies. It has the potential for reducing costs by leveraging economies
of scale. It also allows an organization to take advantage of application
service provider expertise. With these advantages, however, comes a radical
change to the way IT operates. Applications must be built differently,
methods for supporting applications change, new roles and skillsets are
required, and requirements must be specified in a rather precise fashion.
<p>The purpose of this workshop is to explore different models of outsourcing
and what challenges and solutions arise for each model. Session participants
will work in small groups to brainstorm challenges and solutions and share
the results with other participants. All participants will take away from
the session the collective wisdom of the group applied to the challenges
of oursourcing applications.</blockquote>

<td><b>Audience:</b>
<br>Participants are expected to have fairly extensive experience in at
least one aspect of application architecture such as defining a corporate
data model, describing and measuring business processes, designing and
developing distributed applications for the internet environment, implementing
a corporate security model, supporting applications, and auditing application
environments. Participants are expected to have some experience in planning
or implementing the outsourcing of applications. Any such background is
welcome, the more diverse the group, the better the session will be.</td>

the assumptions/procedures which no longer hold true when applications
are outsourced, and the new types of requirements arising from outsourcing.</li>

<li>
Participants brainstorm to identify the challenges to achieving the requirements
they identified and ideas for overcoming these challenges.</li>
