<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE>It's fashionable to say that a component is specified in terms of what
it provides and what it requires. For the purposes of this session we
can restrict this to specifying the interfaces it provides and the
interfaces (of other components) with which it collaborates to carry
out its responsibilities.
<P>
The question addressed by this workshop is "Does information about
what a component requires form part of its contract with its clients?".
<P>
If we answer "yes" then that implies that the clients depend in some
way on the downstream collaborations of the component and may be
affected by changes to them. But if we say "no" then we must ensure
that the component's interface definitions are sufficient to provide
all the information required by the client. For example, if a client
uses the OrderManager and CreditCheck interfaces provided by two
separate components, does the client need to know that these two
components, in turn, get their information about customers from the
same CustomerManager interface?
<P>
It appears that a common reason for answering "yes" to this question
is the hope or belief that knowledge of downstream collaborations will
allow the client to deduce the set of *instances* being manipulated.
Using the previous example, a client might assume that since
OrderManager and CreditCheck both use CustomerManager they share a
set of underlying customers, with consequential consistency of customer
keys. It might of might not be valid to make such an assumption,
depending on the semantics of the modelling language.This workshop will
therefore also examine the difference between specifications of behviour
of types and specifications of information sets.

John Daniels is an object technology pioneer, with more than 15 years 
experience of object modelling and design. He has helped many
organisations exploit object technology - and now components!
<P>
The content of this workshop is based on John's experience working
with Sterling Software, where he helped create a meta-model for a
component modelling language based on UML and Catalysis.

John has been a session leader at every OT conference, and has a
track-record of enthusiastic participant response and high ratings.

<H4>Material</H4>
Participants will be provided with a statement of the problem being
considered plus examples. In the first part of the workshop groups
will follow a worksheet containing exercises that explore the issues.
A questionaire and template will be provided to aid the creation of
posters.

<H4>Delivery</H4>
The outputs will be the questionaires completed by each group plus a
consolidated position poster. A summary will be posted on a web site
after the event.

<H4>Format</H4>
Group working, with groups joining to find a consensus.
