<BLOCKQUOTE>The internet has significantly changed the nature of the way
today's companies do their business, and in doing so, has also impacted
the way systems need to be created, deployed and maintained. Customers
are demanding personalized information at a moment's notice; businesses
are looking to outsourcing and partnering to reduce costs; and intense
competition is demanding that whatever is developed, it better be done
at "netspeed".

<P>The tools market is valiantly trying to address these new requirements,
but has it truly succeeded in supporting these notable shifts in the development
paradigm?&nbsp; In this think tank, we will examine the requirements for
our brave new world and assess how well the tool vendors are meeting them.
As a bonus, attendees are encouraged to take these ideas to their new startups
and make a fortune!</BLOCKQUOTE>

Participants will leave the think tank with a better understanding of&nbsp;
how development in the new world of the web differs from traditional development
both in terms of content, delivery mechanism and development process. It
will help clarify their thinking on both how to utilize existing tools
and what kinds of new tools they should be looking for.
