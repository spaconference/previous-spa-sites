<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE>                Recent years saw the emergence of a new paradigm in software
development, i.e.,
                the component-oriented & component-based paradigm. The move
towards components
                has largely been industry-driven. At the beginning of the
new millenium
                technology has progressed so far that there are no technical
hindrances to a
                widespread use of componentware worth mentioning. The world
of components seems
                to be firmly grounded on technologies and standards (e.g.,
CORBA, DCOM and
                JavaBeans), on component frameworks (e.g., Boca (OMG) and
the SAP R/3 Business
                Framework), on COTS, etc. However, methodology hasn't
caughted up on the
                new trend. Although some work is observed in the field of
component-based
                software development/engineering (CBSD/E), there isn't much
methodological
                support for component-oriented software
development/engineering (COSD/E), apart
                from the work on component-oriented programming (COP). Has
anyone heard from
                component-oriented analysis & design (COAD) yet? We haven't.
<P>
                The goal of this think-tank session is to discuss the need
for a rigorous
                approach towards the development of software components and
to identify
                requirements for a COAD method. Our starting point are the
current OOAD methods,
                as we see Object-Orientation as a sine qua non for
Component-Orientation.
                However, is Object-Orientation alone enough? What else is
needed to
                transform the current OOAD methods into COAD methods? What
specific
                methodological support is currently missing in our
approaches towards
                Component-Orientation?
<P>
                The think-tank session tries to answer questions of this
kind and gives
                participants a forum to express their needs and requirements
for
                component-oriented methodology. It is time that researchers
take the
                new paradigm seriously!

        Dr. Poels is a Postdoctoral Fellow of the Fund for Scientific
Research - Flanders,
        working with the information systems group of the Dept. of Applied
Economics at the
        Catholic University of Leuven.  His research interests include
object-oriented software
        measurement and quantitative approaches in component-oriented
software engineering.

Conference
        (Amsterdam, 6-8 October 1999).

        Dr. Dedene is a Professor of management information systems at the
Dept. of
        Applied Economics, Catholic University of Leuven. His lecturing and
research
        activities concentrate on formal methods for systems development and
quantitative
        systems management techniques. He is co-author of the book
"Object-Oriented
        Enterprise Modelling with MERODE", published in the summer of 1999.

<H3>Topics</H3><UL><LI> Differences between Object-Orientation and
Component-Orientation
<LI> Specific CO-related problems that OOAD methods do not /
cannot solve
<LI> Is there a need for COAD methods?
<LI> What are the requirements for COAD methods?
</UL>
<H3>Benefits</H3>                Participants will learn about the differences between
Object-Orientation
                and Component-Orientation (and the differences between
component-based
                development and component-oriented development). They will
also learn
                about the sorry state of the contemporary methodological
support for COSD/E.
                But more important, they will have the opportunity to
express their specific
                needs and requirements regarding such methodological
support.
                The session is not a tutorial but an interactive event in
which we,
                as researchers, might also learn something from the
participants.

<B>Audience:</B>                 The session is intended for all practitioners
planning/making/completing the
                move from Object-Orientation towards Component-Orientation,
or all practitioners
                otherwise interested in the component paradigm. We equally
welcome all
                researchers (academia and others) struggling with the same
questions as we have.
                We expect practitioners to have a basic knowledge of objects
and components, just
                enough to appreciate the differences between both worlds. We
do not require
                participants to be experts in (specific) OOAD methods.

<H4>Material</H4>
                The material presented during the introduction will be made
available to
                the participants. This will include examples in which the
requirements of
                the OO and CO worlds seem to be conflicting. We also prepare
a list of
                questions to gauge the reactions and sentiments of the
participants. This
                list should be made available on the web page of the
session.

<H4>Delivery</H4>
                We plan to produce a poster that can act as a sort of
position paper for the
                think-tank participants. We hope this poster will express
what practitioners
                expect from a COAD method or the COSD/E methodology in
general. At the very
                least the poster should answer the question raised by the
session leaders: do
                we need component-oriented analysis & design methods?
<P>
                We further plan to circulate the position paper among
researchers (academic
                and others) working on the component-oriented paradigm, and
to submit it to
                workshops dealing with COSD/E.

<H4>Format</H4>
                The first part necessarily includes a bit of lecturing to
clarify the
                issues raised.  The second part can be much more informal,
although we
                will initially structure the discussion using a list of
questions prepared
                in advance.
