<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE>    Extreme Programming is a new approach to software development,
devised
by Kent Beck (Keynote OT'99). Its strength derives from its use of a
range
of techniques, such as User Stories and Pair Programming, to maintain a
balance between the forces that drive a software project.
<P>
The idea of a Balloon Debate is that the speakers are all riding in a
leaking hot-air balloon that must lose weight or crash. At each stage,
the
audience must decide which speaker represents the least benefit to the
World and so can be thrown out to save the others. Each speaker will
represent
one of the techniques of Extreme Programming and plead its importance so
as to
avoid being jettisoned from the balloon.
<P>
Although only one speaker will be allowed to remain in the balloon, the
debate will bring out the importance of all the techniques to the
success of
Extreme Programming and show how they interact and support each other.
<P>
n.b. so far, Oli Bye, Steve Freeman, Tim Mackinnon, Peter Marks, and
John
Nolan have agreed to take part. We intend to have a chair person and 5-6
speakers.

   The London Extreme Group is a monthly meeting of software
professionals
based in London who are enthusiasts for Extreme Programming. We use the
meetings to share our practical experiences and to deepen our
understanding
of how to make Extreme Programming work.

<H3>Benefits</H3>  The session is designed to explore the techniques, such as User
Stories
and Pair Programming, that make up Extreme Programming. Participants
will be
asked to consider each technique in turn for throwing out of the
balloon.
This will lead to a better understanding of the balance between these
techniques and how they interact and support each other.

<H4>Material</H4>
  A description of Extreme Programming with references to the relevant

<H4>Delivery</H4>
  We do not expect any formal deliverables. The intention is to
stimulate
debate about and understanding of how the techniques of Extreme
Programming
interact and support each other.
<P>

<H4>Format</H4>
  The session will be led with some degree of formality (perhaps using a
gavel) by the chairperson to retain the atmosphere of a game with rules,
and
to keep things moving. We encourage flag-waving, heckling, and other
forms
of participation.
