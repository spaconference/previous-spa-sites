<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE><P>
    In Deborah Tannen's book, she describes how men and women often
    misunderstand each other because of fundamental differences in
    their use of language. Similarly, in too many situations, managers
    and developers just don't understand each other; their concerns,
    interests, and even personalities are too divergent. But, to be
    professional, developers must be able to get things done in their
    organisations.
<P>
    This workshop will attempt to bridge that divide by showing
    technical staff how they may be perceived by their non-technical
    colleagues and how to make themselves understood. We also welcome
    managers who need better understanding of their developers.

    This workshop will use role-playing to lead developers to a better
    understanding of how they are perceived by non-technical managers,
    and of how to get their point across when it matters.

<H4>Material</H4>
    A brief description of the session and the issues it will cover.
<P>

<H4>Delivery</H4>
<P>
   The workshop will produce a summary of the flip sheets prepared by
   each of the groups.
<P>

<H4>Format</H4>
<P>
    Session participants will be divided into small groups, each of
    which represents an imaginary organisation. We will prepare a
    description of the organisation and of a task or project that
    needs to be completed.
<P>
    Each member of the group will be assigned a role, such as Finance
    Director, to play during the session. We will prepare a
    description of each role that includes its motivations and
    relationships with other roles in the group. There will be only
    one developer in each group.
<P>
    In the first session, the members of the group will establish
    their positions and start the project. During this process we will
    introduce some minor project risks, such as new competition or
    technology developments. The group will then have to adjust to
    cope with these changes.
<P>
    In the second session, we will introduce major threats to the
    project, such as a draconian funding cuts or key staff
    leaving. Once again, the group will have to negotiate to cope with
    these new changes, but under considerably more stress and for
    higher stakes.
<P>
    Finally, each group will write up a flip sheet to summarise their
    experiences, and present those experiences to the workshop as a
    whole.
