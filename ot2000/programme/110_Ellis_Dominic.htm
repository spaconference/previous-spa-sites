<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE>              This case study examines the checkered history of a
component reuse
              programme within a professional services firm. It charts
the progress
              of the programme through initial ambitious failure to more
 recent
              moderate but sustained success. It charts the pit-falls of
 a component
              reuse programme from the perspective of those that have
actually
              fallen into them. It also shows how progress and success
can be
              sustained despite the many technical and organisational
barriers to
              reuse which exist.
