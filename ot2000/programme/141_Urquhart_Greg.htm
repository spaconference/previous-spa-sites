<blockquote>Specifying requirements quickly yet precisely is always difficult.
Specifying requirements of constantly emerging telecommunications technologies
and adapting to changes and fads is a near impossible task. Kingston-SCL
have implemented process improvements, based on Catalysis with UML, allowing
us to remain at the front of the market.
<p>Applying Catalysis techniques to construct UML models raised many pertinent
questions about the requirements. This was done at an early stage in the
development when the cost and impact of resolving these issues is significantly
less than most organisations incur.
<p>By creating a UML model of our requirements that was much simpler than
the implementation, we were able to discuss important requirements much
more readily than they could have been in terms of the implementation model.
<p>We were adding new functionality to and amending existing functionality
of Jupiter. We did this by mapping our abstract model onto the implementation
structure using the 'retrieval' technique. This allowed us to trace requirements
through to code updates.
<p>We used a phased development process similar to RUP.</blockquote>
