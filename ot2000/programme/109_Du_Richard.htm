<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE>                        This Case study gives the practical, project
management results of an actual project that used an automated software
factory to deliver a new system. The software factory is especially
constructed to reliably produce web-enabled, platform independent,
e-commerce systems in a 20 week or less timeframe. This case study discusses
the use of the software factory from the perspective of a user of the
developed system. Special attention is given to the dangers and weaknesses
of component based development. The session ends with a discussion of the
consequences of the software factory approach to the traditional systems
developer and user.
