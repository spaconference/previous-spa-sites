<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE>Business process re-engineering, design and improvement techniques are known to use various notations including flow chart diagrams, which are not standardised. UML activity diagrams can potentially be an excellent tool which helps business analysts to capture business requirements free from use case modelling, but still being within the scope of the UML standard. This workshop explores traditional modelling techniques in the business modelling area, and explains how these techniques can be expressed using standard UML. It also explains how these models can be used as an input to systems development based on a use case modelling approach.

<H4>Material</H4>
A paper summarising the presentation. A copy of the slides can also be made available.

<H4>Delivery</H4>

Summaries of attendees' findings.

<H4>Format</H4>
			
			
Interactive presentation, where delegates will be asked what techniques they are aware of in the business modelling area...
<P>
This is an interactive session. Attendees will be asked to work in groups, in every step of the session. At each key step, a list of findings from each group will be presented to the rest of the class. The presenter will then relate the findings to the proposed solution. Attendees will be asked to make comments. The proposed solution can then be refined accordingly. The presenter is intending to make use of slides, to compare the attendees findings with hers.
