<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE><P>
We are often told that standard modelling languages such as UML are
necessary for intra-project communication.  This is undoubtedly true for
discussion between designers and developers in general.  However, when this
philosophy is extended to joint application development and communication
with users the approach often breaks down.  Users have to be 'taught' to
speak the language of developers so that they can then express their
knowledge in this foreign tongue.  The alternative to this arrogant
approach is the development of a context-specific common language that can
be easily understood by both groups in the context of a particular project
or business area.  Object technology provides a good basis for the dynamic
generation of such languages.  The approach that we have developed to this
has been used successfully on many projects.
<P>
In the simulation, the participants will start with a brief statement of a
problem in an area which some may not be familiar, though some will.  They
will then be guided through a process that constructs a modelling language,
ending with an object model of the conceptual domain.  This will be then
tested against other parts of the model using a formal 'game' involving
rôle playing.
<P>
The lessons learnt will be published as a short paper.
