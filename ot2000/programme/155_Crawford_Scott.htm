Learn from a Demonstration of Working Enterprise Java Beans</h3></center>

<blockquote>This session focuses on the a demonstration of how Enterprise
Java Beans would be used by an investment bank. A laptop computer will
demonstrate the operation of actual EJBs deployed into IBM's WebSphere
EJB Container, and then a "backstage tour" will be given. Participants
will see the source code and other elements that had to be developed in
order to make the demonstration work, and given opportunities to ask questions
about how the pieces fit together. They will also see all of the steps
involved in deploying a new EJB into the system. Finally, there will be
a discussion about the current state of EJB technology and what is and
isn't possible today.

<h3>
Benefits</h3>
Participants will see real EJBs in action, and no longer have to wonder
whether they are just some future hype. They will also gain a clear idea
of how the abstract concepts from the EJB specification are applied to
an actual case, and what steps are required to make it happen. Finally,
they should learn about the current possibilities and frustrations in working
with this technology.

<td><b>Audience:</b>
<p>Anyone who is interested in EJBs and has some conceptual knowledge of
what they are for. No experience or detailed knowledge is required, although
participants who had EJB experience and wanted to come along and compare
notes with the session leader would be most welcome. No knowledge of investment
banking is required, as the minimal amount needed will be given during
the demonstration.&nbsp;</td>

Slides that describe the business problem, the mappings between it and
the EJB specification, and breakdown the system into its constituent parts.
