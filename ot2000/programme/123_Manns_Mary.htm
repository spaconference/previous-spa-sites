Many of those who attend OT2000 will most likely have heard that patterns
are showing some noteworthy potential for capturing best practices in
software development.  However, it is also quite likely that many of these
same individuals will have experienced the difficulties in convincing
others in their organizations of this potential.  Their experiences may be
due, in some part, to the fact that the benefits of patterns are realized
in the long term while, in the shorter term, there is much work to be done
in mining and recording best practices.  Comments such as the following
reveal that the task of doing this in an organization is not a simple one:
<P>
<I>It's tough.  We're dealing with product development cycles as short as
a couple of months so there is no time to introduce something new.  We're
into instant gratification.  We're not as willing to study things,
internalize things, and make them part of the culture in order to get a
big payback in the long term </I>[John Letourneau, Lucent Technologies,
personal conversation at PLoP'99].
<P>
<i>In today's business environment, letting this process happen requires
extraordinary management insight.  The process requires introspection,
which means time, a scare commodity when the rallying cry is "turn that
around fast and move onto the next product"</I>  [Linda Rising, in The
Patterns Handbook, 1998:2].
<P>
Introducing and sustaining interest in patterns in an organization
requires a long and tedious effort.  The many conversations we had with
those who have attempted this task and our personal experiences at U S
WEST Advanced Technologies (Manns) and BT (O'Callaghan) have allowed us to
believe that the challenges are, to some degree, standing in the way of
obtaining widespread use of patterns.  Although there is certainly a large
amount of interest in patterns, much of this interest appears to exist
primarily among individuals.  Unfortunately, very few organizations have
embraced patterns.
<P>
The spark for patterns in an organization most often begins with one or
more enlightened individuals who has heard about or used patterns and is
intrigued over their potential.  It then becomes the task of these
individuals to enlighten the rest of the organization.  This is usually a
rather large undertaking.  However, it is likely to be easier if one has
an understanding of the problems that may be encountered along the way and
the solutions that can be used to solve these problems.
<P>
Work towards documenting these problems and solutions in the form of
patterns was begun by David DeLano and Linda Rising of AG Communication
Systems in Arizona during their <I>Introducing Patterns into an
Organization</I> workshop at OOPSLA'96.  While their patterns form a
strong and extremely useful foundation, the emphasis is on the
introduction of patterns, with only a few patterns considering how one can
sustain the momentum.  Maintaining a strong momentum is vital if an
organization is to achieve a culture that remains interested in and
committed to using and writing patterns.
<P>
Therefore the work begun by DeLano and Rising needs to be broadened.  Our
work over the past year has been attempting to do this in the form of a
pattern language currently titled <I>Evolving a Patterns Culture</I>.  The
first seven patterns in this language were shepherded and workshopped at
PLoP'99 this past August.  The current version, recently updated following
feedback at PLoP is available on the web at:  <a href http://www.cs.unca.edu/~manns>www.cs.unca.edu/~manns</a>
<P>
Many others patterns are also being drafted. All the patterns are the
outcome of personal experiences and countless conversations with many
individuals.  While some of these conversations have occurred over the
phone and through email, the majority have been at conferences and other
gatherings.  We have found that listening to the stories of those who have
tried to convince others of patterns is an excellent way to mine the
patterns in this language, discover the instances of use, and receive the
feedback needed to produce a quality language. The working group session
we are proposing for OT2000 will do all of these things.

organization<br>
<LI> mining patterns from these stories<br>
<LI> discovering individual uses of the existing and the new patterns we will
draft during this session<br>

This session is for all those who have attempted to convince others of the
value of patterns (or any innovation).  It is likely to attract those who
have struggled with introducing and sustaining interest in patterns in an
organization and those who are expected to face this task in the near
future.

<H4>Delivery</H4>
<P>
Deliverables from this session will be:<br>
-- Challenges in institutionalizing patterns in an organization, some
potential solutions, along with the context of the challenges,
consequences of the solution and instances of use will be recorded
throughout the day.  These will be transcribed, emailed to each
participant, and posted on the web. <br>
-- Some pattern drafts will be written.  These have the potential to be
added to the Evolving a Patterns Culture language.<br>
-- A poster summarizing some of the outcomes of this session will be
created for display during the conference.
<P>

<H4>Format</H4>
                       
 
 The working group will follow a format we have used in other sessions
 that had the goal of discovering challenges and solutions and mining
 potential patterns.  Since this type of format requires a considerable
 amount of time, we have proposed it as a working group. It will be
 conducted as follows: <ul>
 <li> The session will begin with an introduction to
 the topic.  Findings and patterns written to date will be discussed. 
 (Interested participants will have the opportunity to read these
 patterns before the day of working group; perhaps they can be made
 available through a link in the description of this session on the
 OT'2000 page.)
 <li> Challenges will then be brainstormed and recorded on
 large papers.  (Usually these are flipchart papers taped to the walls.
  Since this is not permitted at the OT venue, cardboard-type paper
 will be spread out on a large table.)  Each piece of paper will
 contain one challenge.
<li> Potential solutions to each of the challenges
 will be brainstormed and recorded, in a different colored ink, on the
 same paper as the challenge. <br>
 <li> Other factors, such as context, consequences and relationships 
 between patterns will also be noted on each paper. <br>
 <li> Participants will then study and discuss what appears on the 
 cardboard papers. <br>
 <li> First drafts of some potential patterns to record 
 the information on the papers will be drafted.<br> 
 <li> The session will conclude by summarizing what was accomplished and 
 identifying the work yet to be done.
