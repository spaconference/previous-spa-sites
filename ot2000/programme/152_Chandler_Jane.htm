<blockquote>As the use of patterns becomes mainstream and widespread many
using patterns are unaware of their origins in Christopher Alexander's
work on architectural patterns together with his ideas on wholeness and
centres. This session will therefore provide an overview of Christopher
Alexander's work as an introduction to the theoretical basis of patterns
by means of simulations and games.

<h4>
Delivery</h4>

<h4>
Format</h4>
The session will start with a general introduction and the participants
being split into small groups. Each group will be introduced to and have
the opportunity to play four of the games listed below. The 30 minutes
each group spends with a game will include time to reflect on the game
and the things they have learnt from it. The final 30 minutes of the session
will be an opportunity for reflection on games, the things learnt and suggestions
for refining the games.
<p>Pattern Families - based on Happy Families the aim is to collect as
many Alexander pattern families as possible e.g Ornament Context, Ornament
Problem, Ornament Solution, Ornament Connected Patterns
<p>Carpet Pairs - similar to Pairs where all cards are placed faced down
and you have to find two which match but in this case using Alexander's
Turkish carpets
<p>Treasure Hunt - find various treasures in Alexander's works
<p>Center Dominos - be the first to match all your centers, positive spaces,
symmetries and animals with those of others
<p>Alexander's Game - a quiz game on Alexander and his work based on the
"The Bird-Table Game" board game which aims to educate as it goes and keep
everyone in with a chance of winning until the end
<p>QWAN and Anti-QWAN - An introduction to QWAN and wholeness based on
Snakes and Ladders

Introduction, description of games and splitting into groups (20 minutes)
<p>Each group will visit 4 of the games spending 30
<br>minutes playing each one (120 minutes)
<p>Report back by groups (30 minutes)
