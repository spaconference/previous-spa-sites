<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE>This session offers a chance for participants to evaluate the state of the
art in the process area.  The discussion can cover anything from waterfalls
and V models to RUP and the OPEN process but is not restricted to these. 
It is to be hoped that useful comparisons and definitions will emerge and
that these can be presented as a poster.  The discussion will also be
encouraged to into specific areas such as the requirements process.
