Extreme programming encompasses many concepts that are both familiar and
unfamiliar to many programmers. When you start out on an extreme project it
is very difficult to know what it feels like to adopt many of the values
that it proposes. Just as when early pioneers of OO were arguing about what
was an object, new adopters of XP can easily get stuck trying to decide
"What is the simplest thing". Those practitioners that rolled up their
sleeves and practiced using objects quickly got beyond trying to define what
an object was - it became something they just knew.
<P>
We have noticed a similar thing with XP - our early attempts to balance all
of the XP values were a struggle because we weren't used to what it felt
like to be extreme. After several experiments with different teams, we have
found that in a "doing" environment, developers can experience extreme
programming and this gives them a headstart when they apply it to their
projects.
<P>
This simulation will allow programmers to feel what it's like being extreme.
Rather than sitting around discussing problems and experiences, we will be
actively working on a project in pairs, in parallel. '''Practitioners will
have to collaborate, trust each other and use short iterations to accomplish
the problem'''. As it is often difficult to achieve these goals in a short
period of time when using computers and different programming languages - we
have hit upon a unique way of sharing this feeling through the use of LEGO
Mindstorms. As everyone knows how to use LEGO - it is a great level playing
field that gives us the ability to concentrate on the XP values rather than
the merits of different programming languages.

Tim has been programming with objects for 10 years, however it was when he
heard Kent Beck describe Extreme Programming at OOPSLA 98 and again at OT99
that he found a process that balances quality, delivery and happiness. Tim
was a member of the team that created UML Modeler for VisualAge Smalltalk,
he has also worked at Dashboards Software where he pioneered their use of
Extreme Programming. He is now a senior developer at Connextra where he is
even more extreme. Tim is also one of the founders of www.xpdeveloper.com -
a site that encourages developers to document their experiences with XP.

Oli is 27 and has been hacking since the age of 11. Since his Masters
CompSci he worked for HSBC, and saw SBC through several mergers to becoming
UBS. From medical pumps in 68HC11 Assembler, to Global FX trading systems in
Java, he loves to program. Since building his own internet server in early
1999 he's been helping small startups, academics and open source projects
get off the ground by providing services for the virtually homeless. He
currently coaches Extreme programming for a living, and is a founder of
www.xpdeveloper.com

Paul has created software commercially for 13 years in a variety of industry
sectors, though his first income from software was £1 at the age of 14.  He
believes in software development as a creative process and is a keen
advocate of teamsmanship.  He first heard of Extreme Programming from the
enthusiastic Tim MacKinnon and learnt more at OT99.

SESSION DETAILS
<P>
These paragraphs will be published in the brochure and on the web site
if your proposal is accepted.
<P>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<H3>Topics</H3><UL><P>
This simulation will:
<LI> Briefly introduce the XP values
<LI> Cover our experiences with these values and some of the approaches that
we have found useful
<LI> Quickly move on to letting the attendees roll up their sleeves and
actively try out the approaches
<LI> Reflect on how things worked with the aim to documenting approaches for
future XP developers
<P>
</UL>
<H3>Benefits</H3><P>
Participants who attend this workshop will:
<LI> Have fun being extreme and playing with LEGO Mindstorms
<LI> Learn by "doing" and arguing through tests
<LI> Experience paired programming, and the knowledge exchanged by rotating
partners
<LI> Understand how to work in extremely short iterations
<P>

<B>Audience:</B> <P>
Attendees should be familiar with the Extreme Programming material, but do
not have to have practiced the ideas. It is also necessary to know how to
use LEGO <grin>, but not necessarily Mindstorms. Advanced XP practitioners
should not attend this session (they can play with the LEGO afterwards).
<P>

</TD><TD>
<B>Max</B> 20 (this assumes 8 Mindstorms kits, 2 kits per team)
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<H4>Material</H4>
<P>
We will prepare some of our thoughts on XP (15 minute iterations, our
experiences with pairs). We will also prepare a sample observation sheet
that will be used by the observers for the reflection process (to help
understand what worked and what didn't).
<P>
We will provide 8 LEGO Mindstorm sets, including software, with a running
program and robot to act as a starting point.
<P>
We will need 4 machines with a free COM port (for communicating with the
robots) onto which we can install the LEGO Mindstorms software.
<P>
We will need some flipchart paper and markers for the reflection excercise
<P>

<H4>Delivery</H4>
<P>
Groups will write-up their reflections on flip charts (what worked what
didn't - hilights etc). We would also like to race the resulting robots in
an evening session (possibly running it as a social event where people can
read the flipcharts for each team, and place bets on which robot they think
will win).
<P>

<H4>Format</H4>
<P>
As per the structure, we will do a brief presentation and then move on to
working on the models, followed by time for reflection and then a
demonstration.
