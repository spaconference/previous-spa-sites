<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE>	The notion of non-trivial systems having software architectures
	is one that is gaining ground. But what is architecture? How can it be
	defined? More importantly how do you go about creating a software
	architecture that can be maintained successfully over the lifetime of a
	potentially long-lived system, and what are the organisational, social and
	process implications of generating such an architecture?  What roles are
	played by layers, frameworks, patterns and components?
<P>
	This workshop explores the relationship between building and software
	architecture, drawing in particular on functional architectures such as
	modern office environments for suitable comparison. The notions of space
	and boundaries in buildings have their counterparts in software, and offer
	an alternative way of considering traditional software concepts.

</TD><TD width=75%>	Alan O'Callaghan has been a Senior Lecturer at De Montfort University in
	the UK for ten years, having previously worked for the London Transport
	Executive, British Oxygen and Kodak. He has been working with object
	technology since 1991, and is well-known in the UK for his work on the
	migration of legacy systems to object technology, having pioneered
	developments in industrial projects in telecoms, the defence industry and
	the machine-tools industry. He has edited two books on object technology
	transfer, and is a regular columnist in the European SIGS journal,
	Application Development Advisor. He has presented talks, tutorials and
	workshops at Object Expo in London, OOP in Munich, Object World UK, Object
	Technology 9X and the OOPSLA Educators' Symposium as well as a number of
	industrial seminars and conferences.

	consults, writes and delivers training courses and seminars in C++,
	Java, OOD, patterns, distributed objects, and component architectures.
	He has been working with object	technology and some of its cultural
	offshoots for longer than he cares to remember, and tries to
	share/inflict these experiences with/on others at any opportunity,
	typically through the medium of articles, conference papers, conference
	talks, workshops and courses.

<H3>Topics</H3><UL><LI> Points in common between building architecture and software architecture.
<LI> Concepts specific to building architecture, in particular office design.
<LI> Concepts familiar in software architecture, with some comparison against
	  building architecture.
<P>
</UL>
<H3>Benefits</H3>	The workshop is intended to arm the participant with both philosophical and
	practical notions of software architecture that will enable them to engage
	in the generation of appropriate software architectures for the problems they
	have to solve as a computer professional. It is also hoped to give them the
	opportunity to have a play with connecting toys in a conference environment.

<H4>Material</H4>
<LI> Presentation slides that are used within the workshop.
<LI> Additional notes, plus references, describing some of the ideas
	  and positions taken by the presenters and others.

<H4>Delivery</H4>
	Posters, and potential scope for sparking off BOFs.

<H4>Format</H4>
	The session will start with presented material and progress to a more
	conventional workshop format, based on groups of 3 to 6 people working on
	a common problem. There will be some movement between groups and a wrap up
	session at the end.
<P>
	The intent is to make the session highly interactive, which may	involve
	putting some worn metaphors to an empirical test, eg components as Lego
	bricks, Meccano, etc.
