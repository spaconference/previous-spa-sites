<blockquote>Now is your chance to build tomorrow's technical infrastructure.
Bridge the gap between those legacy back-end systems, and some state of
the art web servers, with your very own middleware. Pick from the best
of what's commercially available, or design your own from scratch, and
e-enable a traditional business in record time! Meanwhile, don't forget
that the business itself may have to change radically to embrace the new
way of working.
<p>Many traditional industries are struggling with the effort to embrace
the internet. One of the challenges they face is how to change their IT
systems so as to make the information they contain, and the transactional
capabilities they support, accessible to on-line customers. It involves
connecting customers directly to back-end processing systems, in real time.
Some of the requirements are:-
<p>Interaction with several back-end systems. Delivery of accurate, timely
data. Rapid response. Ability to survive system crashes Security and access
control. Transactional capability across multiple systems. Graceful failure
under extreme loads.
<p>In the present case it will be assumed that the business has the following
strategic priorities, in decreasing order of importance:-
<ul>
<li>
Time to market.</li>

<li>
Flexibility/extensibility</li>

<li>
Functionality</li>

<li>
Cost.</li>
</ul>
The purpose of this think tank is to enable practitioners (and would-be
practioners) to share their ideas on the best ways of meeting this challenge.
This will involve proposing an outline technical solution, and indicating
the possible organsiational and business impacts which could arise. Solutions
shouldbe rated against each of the client's priorities.
