<blockquote>Software systems have a use.&nbsp; That use is multi-dimensional.&nbsp;
Organisations and developers often focus on the design from the inside
out.&nbsp; They study business needs (business models) and technical issues
of design (technical design models).&nbsp; The user operates from the outside
in.&nbsp; Many software systems are designed with little regard for the
use by the user (use models).&nbsp; And, there are other use's --- political,
psychological, cultural, emotional and so on.
<p>This workshop aims to investigate and develop a shared awareness of
the use and effect of designs of some current software systems.

<h4>
Material</h4>
&nbsp;
<h4>
Delivery</h4>
A review of the viewpoints, issues and attitudes prevalent in software
design with respect to the use and effect of designs.
<p>A commentary on areas for action.
<h4>
Format</h4>
We will study some ubiquitous designs to investigate and review what the
use is.
<p>Participants will be invited to suggest designs to review (in advance
if possible), but as a fall back I will select some candidate designs.&nbsp;
On the day, participants will select a subset to investigate.
<p>The workshop will take place in a structured way investigating aspects
of&nbsp; use (as suggested above), in groups where dialog, debate and sharing
is encouraged.&nbsp; It will develop from small groups sharing to sharing
in the large.
