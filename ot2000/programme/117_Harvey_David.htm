<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE>Most of us have lived through at least one revolution in software 
development. Structured programming, CASE, object orientation, software 
architecture, patterns - all seem to have promised to solve the problems 
of building software systems, yet still projects fail. In the first part 
this workshop session we will start by looking at and questioning some of 
the received wisdom surrounding development. We will ask the question - 
"what if this weren't so?" and share our experiences to build a picture of 
how development might be possible freed of the habits of organisation, 
approach and thought that have clearly failed the software industry to 
date.
<P>
In the second part we will look at three examples of an approach to 
development which - individually and collectively - challenge traditional 
assumptions. The Programmers' Stone, originally an eight-day course on 
thinking in programming, goes to the heart of creativity in software; 
Dynamics of Software Development is a seminal book which focuses on 
creating the right conditions to keep a team of minds in the game of 
software development; and Extreme Programming is a new discipline of 
development which, drawing on the unique nature of software, rigorously 
excludes all it considers to be inessential. Reflecting on these ideas, 
participants will write a new rulebook of values and principles for 
software development.

David Harvey has over a decade of experience in designing, building and 
managing the development of software. He is currently Global Architect for 
ORB Infrastructure at Warburg Dillon Read, and has worked throughout the 
City of London on advanced middleware libraries and architectures. As a 
consultant he has helped organisations make effective use of object 
technology, and has delivered introductory and advanced training courses 
in C++ and OO design. He has presented sessions at the OT conference and 
elsewhere on C++, patterns, distributed computing and software 
architecture, jointly (with Paul Dyson) presented the UK's first workshop 
on Extreme Programming, and was conference chair for OT99.

Peter Marks has been developing software since childhood. Having spent 
most of his working life as a freelance consultant and developer, he is 
increasingly of the belief that, as software developers, we should seek to 
regain our childish invention, playful experimentation and imagination. 
His contributions to conferences in the UK in the last three years have 
included ruminations on the artistic in software and a plea for a simpler 
way: as a participatory games facilitator his giant inflatable ball and 
rubber ring have entered legend. He is currently involved in a wild 
Internet start-up.

<H3>Benefits</H3>Participants will be introduced to some of the most radical new thinking in software development. By reflecting on their own experience, 
they will gain a deeper understanding of some of its underlying 
assumptions: in questioning and countering these they will take a step 
towards bringing new energy to their work in software.

Outputs of reflection - new principles and values for software development

<H4>Format</H4>
Mixed games, presentations and whole-group and small-group discussion.
The core of the first part of the session will involve examining some of 
the received wisdom in software development and asking - what happens if 
we <em>don't</em> do this? As we find more and more cases in which the 
rules are inadequate, participants will be required to tear the rule out 
of the book.
<P>
In the second part, after an outline of several strands of new thinking in 
software development culture (Programmers' Stone, Dynamics of Software 
Development, Extreme Programming) and the commonalities expressed in 
these, small groups will be asked to come up with new rules expressing 
fundamental values in software development.
