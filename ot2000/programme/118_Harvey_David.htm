<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE><P>
All of us have had the experience of focussing so intently on an activity
that sense of time and self seem to vanish. This phenomenon has been
christened <b>flow</b>. In his book <i>Flow: the Psychology of Optimal
Experience</i> psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihaly describes his extensive
research in this area and draws several important conclusions affecting
work, play and culture.
<P>
In this think tank participants will be asked to share their experiences
of flow in any aspect of their lives, and will use these as a springboard
to propose ways of improving our ability to reach this state in the work
we do developing software.

David Harvey has over a decade of experience in designing, building and
managing the development of software. He is currently Global Architect for
ORB Infrastructure at Warburg Dillon Read, and has worked throughout the
City of London on advanced middleware libraries and architectures. As a
consultant he has helped organisations make effective use of object
technology, and has delivered introductory and advanced training courses
in C++ and OO design. He has presented sessions at the OT conference and
elsewhere on C++, patterns, distributed computing and software
architecture, jointly (with Paul Dyson) presented the UK's first workshop
on Extreme Programming, and was conference chair for OT99.

<H4>Material</H4>
Overview and slides for conference materials
<P>
The session will also need some large self-adhesive labels and coloured
pens for a brief introductory activity, and some packets of small coloured
stickers (red and green).
<P>

<H4>Delivery</H4>
The session will deliver a ranked list of actions aimed at restoring flow
to the workplace.
<P>

<H4>Format</H4>
Think-tank: a small amount of presentation to set the context and the
problem, followed by alternating work in small groups on specific tasks
and whole-group review.
<P>
The session is based around three activities. Each of these is undertaken
in groups of 3, and will involve a short period of individual reflection
(2 minutes), followed by discussion and write-up (8 minutes).  The
activities are as follows
<P>
<OL>
<LI> <B>When did you feel most alive?</B><BR>
Individually, write a sentence describing a flow experience you have had.
As a group discuss these. Were they solitary or group efforts? Work or
out-of-work? Are there any significant similarities or differences? For
one, two or all three of these, come up with what you regard to be an
important characteristic of the experience.
</LI>
<P>
<LI> <B>What prevents flow?</B><BR>
In the same way as the previous group, identify and discuss aspects of
character, activity and environment that prevent flow.
</LI>
<P>
<LI> <B>How can we promote flow in our work?</B><BR>
Although the flow experience is reported in the workplace, many aspects of
our working lives prevent this. Identify and discuss up to three proposals
for improving the environment or practice of our work, or indeed our
attitude to it, in order to promote flow.
</LI>
</OL>
<P>
<B>Voting</B></BR>
The last of these activities will result in concrete proposals, each on a
separate piece of A3 or flipchart paper. These will be positioned around
the room (on walls or flip-charts) for two rounds of voting. Each
participant has 10 red and 10 green stickers. In the first round, red
stickers are used. During this round, if any pair of proposals is pretty
much identical, then one of the pair is moved to the location of the other
(any participant may do this). Participants are asked to distribute their
10 red stickers in any way they want - from all 10 on a single proposal to
one on each of ten (all stickers must be used) Following the red voting
round, we'll rank and review the result, then undertake a second round of
voting on the same principles using green stickers (the only difference is
that in this round proposals cannot be merged). Delegates may elect to
change their mind based on merged proposals or what the primary ranking
reveals - for the final ranking only the green sticker count is used.
