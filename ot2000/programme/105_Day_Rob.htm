<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE>"The Deadline", Tom de Marco's novella about the joy andthe heartaches of Webster Tompkins, must rank as THE most readable text on
software project management yet written. The book reflects Tom's standing
as one of the most influential thinkers and authors in the software
industry. The play follows Webster on his journey of self-discovery through
the labyrinth that is software development in Morovia.

<P>
<P>
  Rob is an experienced trainer/mentor in OO methods and
project management but is prepared to sacrifice his reputation in order to
provide OT delegates with the opportunity to see their work in a humourous
light. In addition to being crowned on stage with a pointy-hair wig, Rob
co-scripted last year's play with Alan Wills.

<P>
       Nicholas is an accomplished actor with both large and small
screen credits to his name. Nicholas has little interest in the technology
of OO but is fascinated by the people aspects of software development. His
was the guiding hand that lead to last year's play receiving such rapturous
reviews.

<P>
<P>
       As co-author of the Catalysis blockbuster with Desmond
D'Souza, Alan is already a renowned writer. He is less in the public eye as
playwright but his critical observations of the IT industry served as the
foundation for last year's play. Alan's portrayal of the "French
Operations" role was an acting tour de force.

<P>
       Colston Sanger, aka "Doc Strange", is co-author of "The
Programmer's Stone" (an evil rant circa 1997). He scrapes a living as a
change management consultant. A relative unknown to OT devotees he has been
persuaded to lead the writing of this year's romantic extravagnza.
