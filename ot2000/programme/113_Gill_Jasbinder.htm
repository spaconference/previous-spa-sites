<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE><P>
	Since its creation the Enterprise Java Beans specification has gained
	an impressive amount of interest. However, due to its 'newity' the first
	real-world applications are in development or early release and so there
	is little practical experience available with this popular technology.
	There are many un-answered questions due to this lack of practical knowledge.
	Of the many questions, I will try to answer one: EJB and the persisting of data.
	I hope to pass on the real-world experiences I have gained with EJB and object
	databases in the form of an interactive, practical workshop.  This will involve 
	working through from design to implementation of an EJB application.
<P>
	Enterprise Java Beans is a standard that has been defined by Sun Microsystems
	and backed by almost all of the major players in IT.  The architecture facilitates the 
	development and deployment of transactional, distributed systems. It does this by defining 
	standard Java interfaces to many of the low-level functions needed to implement transactional,
	distributed systems.  Specialist vendors use their expertise to implement these standards and
	so provide the backbone on which developers can build complex systems specific to their 
	business domain.  The performance and ease-of-development obtained from an object database assist 
	to further facilitate the ease in which transactional, distributed systems can be implemented.

<H3>Topics</H3><UL>	1.  Interactive discussion on the need for EJB ( persistence, transactions, distributions, etc )
	2.  Discussion on the persisting of Java objects in Versant
	3.  Walk the group through the design and implementation of a simple Java / Versant application
	4.  Discuss how EJB manages transactions and distributed environments
	5.  Design and implementation of an EJB application using the model from step 3.

<H3>Benefits</H3>	This workshop will benefit those who have a basic understanding of Enterprise Java Beans.  The workshop
	will work towards expanding this knowledge and understanding of Enterprise Java Beans by providing some 
	practical experience.  Participants will walk away having put their knowledge into practise and having 
	implemented an Enterprise Java Beans application using an Object database.

<B>Audience:</B> 	This workshop will benefit those who have some theoretical knowledge of Enterprise Java Beans
	and would like to put this into practise and answer some questions they have regarding this
	technology and to those who have some practical experience and would like to further run through
