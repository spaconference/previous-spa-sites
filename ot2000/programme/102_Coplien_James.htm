<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE>Software architects are not building architects -- or are
they?  Software, like many other new age disciplines,
is at a loss to build on any foundations other than metaphorical
relationships to timeless disciplines. These metaphors lend
an aura of pseudo-credibility to the craft.  Though all metaphors
break down somewhere, it's important to explore these metaphors
so we can properly build on the experience of other disciplines,
avoiding their pitfalls while not falling into the traps that
arise from following the metaphors blindly.
<P>
We propose (but not promise) to bring a (hopefully prominent)
architect to the venue to fuel the activity.
<P>
This workshop builds on results from a workshop at OT 1999
that explored the architecture metaphor using a formal
sociological research technique called grounded theory
development.  The effort is half done;  we have yet to explore
the detailed questions whose answers can add density and
life to the theory of software architecture practice.

James ("Cope") Coplien is a Distinguished Member of Technical Staff
at Bell Laboratories in Naperville, Illinois, USA.  He was guest
editor of the September/October 1999 IEEE Software Special
Issue on Software Architecture which explored piecemeal
growth styles of software development, featuring the first
publication of Christopher Alexander's landmark 1996 OOPSLA
keynote.  Cope conducts research in the architecture of third
party customizable telecommunications platforms and software
architecture patterns.  He also conducts research in the analogous
organizational structures using ethnographic techniques and,
most recently, techniques from grounded theory development.
He is a well-known author of books and columns on object-oriented
programming, C++, patterns, and software organizations. He
enjoys collecting turkish carpets, scuba, and travel.  When
he grows up, he wants to be an anthropologist.

</TD><TD width=75%>Martine Devos is reuse and method consultant for EDS. She was director of
the IS
department at the Belgian department of education (Argo) since 1992 and
before
has worked as teacher, as technical consultant and project leader to the
Belgian
 Minister of Education and the Civil Service. As IS manager she introduced
objec
ts and she initiated, and co-ordinated the development of a framework and
severa
l applications using it. Her main focus is on the use of IS - and "softer
softwa
re" - to support change programs and learning. Special interests are
framework d
evelopment, the use of patterns in organisation, the human side of IS and
facili
tating workshops. She participated in, and organised, several workshops and
pane
ls on System Envisioning, the use of creativity in requirements developing.
She
is program-chair of EuroPlop 2000

<H3>Topics</H3><UL>Grounded theory starts by identifying concept, and groups them into
categories t
hat characterize important phenomena of the topic under study.
The goal of grounded theory is to develop a theory explaining some
phenomenon.
The phenomenon explained is labeled the core category.  It forms the main
"story
line"
<P>
OT'99 's workshop converged on change, role interaction, structure,
economics,
constraints, process and professionalism as groups.  Constraints has the
tightest
coupling to other categories.
<P>
The basic story line: the architect is to balance constraints that arise
from
customers, standards, economics and the people involved in the process...
<P>
Following questions may help:
<P>
<LI> How do architects and other professions handle constraints?
<LI> What are the constraints affecting the process?
<LI> How do constraints relate to the role of architect ... in dealing
with change?
<LI> How is spending distributed over the lifetime of a software
project compared to
           construction projects?
<P>
<P>
</UL>
<H3>Benefits</H3>The industry will benefit from this session by learning
better how both to build on and temper its use of
common professional metaphors.  Individual victims
of those metaphors, such as software "architects"
and "designers", working in "software factories" and
in "software engineering,"  will gain both new perspectives
on the relevance of their jobs to the overall software
life cycle, and will gain broader insights that will
help them analyze the metaphors -- and therefore,
their specific roles in their respective organizations -- as
part of their day-to-day jobs.

<B>Audience:</B> Any software professional who is an architect or who
works closely with a software architect.  The session will
be tuned to an audience of architects.  The session is not
limited to titled architects but to anyone who participates
in the elusively defined activity design, one of whose
fruits is an architecture.  We encourage and seek professionals
from the building profession as key contributors in this
workshop.

<H4>Material</H4>
We encourage participants to read last year's results at
http://www.bell-labs.com/~cope/ArchitectureAsMetaphor.html
before attending the workshop.  In some sense, the goal
of the workshop is to "complete" or elaborate the original
study, in the sense that follow-up studies in grounded
studies can add density to the theory.
<P>

<H4>Delivery</H4>
The results from the workshop will require some post-processing,
as we did for the results from OT '99.  We hope to deliver a paper
similar to last year's.

<H4>Format</H4>
<P>
One technique we will use is the writing of highly structured
short stories or poems that shed light on the questions, drawing
directly on the work experiences that participants bring to
the workshop.  We employ a structured form to hone thinking
more than to strive for normatization.
