<blockquote>This proposal arises from our experiences gained through the
Pedagogical Patterns Project (PPP) [4, 5]. The PPP started during OOPSLA
'95, made its first public appearances at ECOOP '96 and then TOOLS USA
'96; we held our first workshop at OOPSLA '96. Our aim was to capture successful
experiences of learning and teaching OT, from industry or academia, in
a homogeneous, easily-accessible format, and we saw patterns as a suitable
vehicle for achieving this.
<p>We have held sessions at numerous conferences in America and Europe
and have collected in excess of 50 teaching techniques written in pattern
format. Approximately 10 of these have been through the 'shepherding' process,
have been discussed at a writer's workshop, and have been revised. The
PPP, and the proto-patterns themselves, have proved to be useful, and have
helped educators to explore and exchange their teaching experiences.
<p>The contributions come from a wide selection of people with varying
circumstances and backgrounds, and they vary considerably in focus, from
curriculum design to a technique for teaching or learning a specific concept.
Initially we did not see this as a problem as we were trying to collect
successful reusable experience, and the people attending our workshops
encouraged us in our efforts and were enthusiastic about the results. However,
as we have learned more about patterns and pattern languages, it has become
clear that our initial scope was too wide to reap the full benefits that
a pattern language could potentially offer. To produce a targeted pattern
language, we need to focus on a specific area of OT pedagogy.
<p>However, other projects also looking to capture reusable experience
in Computer Science Education are not using a 'pattern' paradigm. For example,
EPCoS uses a notion of 'bundle' and The On-line Computer Science Teaching
Centre aims to collect together reusable resources. This has led us (and
others [3]) to ask what benefits are gained from capturing experience as
'patterns' rather than as guidelines, templates or simple stories?
<p>The workshop will ask participants to consider the benefits of expressing
reusable experience as patterns (as opposed to another homogeneous form).
We will also ask them to consider the kinds of shareable experience they
have, and they would want from others.

<h3>
Topics</h3>

<ul>
<li>
pedagogical patterns</li>

<br>&nbsp;

<h3>
Benefits</h3>
We, and the workshop participants will leave the session knowing more about
initiatives to capture reusable pedagogical experience, and with answers
to the following questions:
<p>What benefits does the 'pattern' paradigm for capturing experience give
to pedagogy?
<p>What disadvantages does the 'pattern' paradigm bring?
<p>What kind of pedagogical experience is it useful to capture?
<p>Do we have patterns in the material we have collected so far?
<p>The output from the session will include a list of benefits and disadvantages
of using the pattern paradigm for pedagogy, a better understanding of the
kind of resuable experience educators are looking for, and some awareness
of how some of the existing, shepherded pedagogical patterns do or do not
shape up to expectations. Although positioned within a framework of 'pedagogy',
some of the issues to be raised and discussed will, we believe, impact
on other pattern-related endeavours.
