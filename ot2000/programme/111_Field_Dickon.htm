<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE>              This case study examines the progress of two long-running
pilots / reference-implementations
              designed to identify the strengths and limitations of the
EJB model and prove the maturity
              or otherwise of various Enterprise Java Bean (EJB)
application development environment technologies.
              It looks at the lessons that have been learnt,
particularly in the architectural approach required
              to produce robust and scaleable EJB applications. It also
examines the key risks associated with
              the technology and the key areas where technology
improvements are required.

<H3>Benefits</H3><LI> Gain a practitioner's insight into the strengths and
limitations of an important technology.
<LI> If considering the adoption of EJB - go into it with
eyes open to its pitfalls as well as how
              to get the most out of it.
<LI> Help identify the kinds of problems which map well onto
EJB and those for which EJB still needs
               to develop as a framework.
