<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE><P>
Many software systems are now being designed as a set of discrete, interacting components, instead of monolithic structures.  Component interfaces specify the syntax of these interactions, and type models can define their semantics.  In order to build a successful software system, however, an additional set of rules governing component interaction, the component architecture, is needed.
<P>
Layering is an important part of the architecture, but is not dealt with in component standards such as EJB and COM.   A good layering of components promotes flexibility by limiting interaction.  The rules by which components can communicate within and between layers should be stated and justified.
<P>
The purpose of this session is to examine the question of component architecture by considering a simple system, dividing it into components, creating a set of layers and assigning components to these layers.  A set of rules governing interaction within and between layers should also be derived.  This will then form the component architecture.

<H3>Benefits</H3>			Participants will consider the different ways in which components can be configured to make up a system, and how their interactions should be specified.  It will be beneficial to anyone who is involved with component-based development.

<H4>Format</H4>
<P>
Mixture of plenary sessions and group work (in groups of 3 - 5).  Groups will produce posters summarising their ideas, for review by other groups.  Some groups will also be encouraged to present one or two key ideas briefly.
