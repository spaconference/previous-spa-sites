<blockquote>During our (short) history as a software profession, we made
some statements that last, that survive. "Goto considered harmful" is one
of them. But do we always get the reactions, the results we expect? When
an OO-guru says "Components are not objects" these four words are used
to communicate a lot of meaning. Academics (and guru's) are experts at
communicating wisdom a few words, and often assume that a lot of foreknowledge
among their audience. But that audience is not limited to computer scientists.
Our managers don't always have that knowledge, neither do some (Java in
24 hours-). They may go for easy money, follow the hype, or often just
literally do "what we told them to do".
<p>What do we create with our statements?
<p>Can we avoid it?

As IS manager she introduced objects and she initiated, and co-ordinated
the development of a framework and several applications using it. Her main
focus is on the use of IS - and "softer software" - to support change programs
