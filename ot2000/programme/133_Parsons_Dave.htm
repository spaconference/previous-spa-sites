<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE>     Visual programming tools have become increasingly common in recent
years and will no doubt become more so in the future.  One of the questions
most often raised by those new to visual programming is 'how do I keep
control of my visual spaghetti?' or words to that effect. This tutorial is
an attempt to answer that question by suggesting some visual programming
patterns that can be reused to effectively manage visual development. The
context for demonstrations will be bean programming with VisualAge for
Java, but many of the patterns are transferable to other visual programming
contexts.

     Dave Parsons is currently a senior consultant/trainer with The Object
People. He has been teaching and writing about object technology since
1991, and has published student-oriented textbooks on C++ and Java for
Letts educational (London). He gained his Ph.D. for work on an extensible
object oriented architecture for a graphical electronic circuit design
system. His current research interests are design pattern metrics and
visual programming. His conference activities have included presentations
at OT96, 97 and 98 and co-organising a workshop at ECOOP 99.

<LI> Some of the problems of visual programming - how do we design for it, how
do we maintain it, how do we make it readable etc...

<H3>Benefits</H3>     This tutorial will benefit anyone either currently using a visual
programming tool or intending to use one in the future, by providing a
toolkit of readily reusable visual design patterns. In this way they may
avoid some of the pitfalls of learning and using a visual programming
environment.

<B>Audience:</B>      It is not essential that participants will already be using a visual
programming tool, since the tutorial will also serve as an introduction to
visual programming. The only prerequisite is that attendees are interested
in visual programming tools.

<H4>Material</H4>
     The documentation will consist primarily of example visual programs,
giving both the anti-pattern (illustrating the problem) and the visual
design pattern (suggesting the design solution). The specific examples are
all in the context of the VisualAge for Java environment, but many of the
patterns can also be applied to less sophisticated visual programming tools

<H4>Delivery</H4>
     A web site will be set up in advance containing information about the
patterns presented at the tutorial. This will be updated after the session
with any new patterns, ideas or comments that arise from the tutorial. Some
poster based material is also expected to be generated during the tutorial

<H4>Format</H4>
     The tutorial will begin as a presentation but move quickly towards
group (paper-based) exercises that will allow the participants to explore
the anti-patterns and perhaps suggest design pattern solutions. It is hoped
that the participants themselves will identify additional design patterns
during the session
