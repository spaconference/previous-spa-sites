Building applications for the electronic business</h3></center>

<blockquote>There are two types of application being developed today. The
first, largely in the hands of the vendor, is the packaged or bespoke application,
which consists of a self-contained, installable set of files and executables
to achieve a given set of aims. The second, in the hands of the IT departments
across the planet, is what we are most interested in here. This is the
application constructed from different elements, bought, built and legacy,
to meet the needs of the business, to underpin business processes and to
manage critical flows of information. This, latter kind of application
cannot be considered as a single entity but as the sum of its parts, and
the processes involved in its construction are very different from those
traditionally associated with application development.
<p>In general, software development within an organisation is still perceived
as a self-contained activity rather than one part of a bigger set of processes.
The result is that methodologies persist, from waterfall and "V" to RAD
and DSDM, which are encouraged to take the needs of the business and the
architecture into account but which are still treated as though a boundary
exists between them and the outside world. Despite the fact that application
developers are encouraged to "think outside the box," involving users and
operational staff where necessary, such involvement rarely attains its
potential due to conflicting pressures. Software development processes
are expanding to cover new needs such as Web Site editorial, but they lag
behind the accelerating pace of technology. The bottom line is that the
paradigm is wrong. Thinking outside the box is wrong, because there is
no box - app development is one of a number of activities, rather than
the central activity which needs to involve others as it goes along. It
goes further than "involving the business", as each organisation is a link
in the supply chain of activity and information flows.

<h3>
Topics</h3>

<ul>Context for application development:
<li>
what kinds of applications are we developing?</li>

<li>
who are the users?</li>

<li>
what technologies are likely to have the most impact over the next few
years?</li>

<li>
what qualities do our systems need to exhibit - accessibility, performance,
etc?</li>

<p><br>Critical Success Factors
<li>
What is important to the business, the IT manager, the developer, the end
user?</li>

<li>
What are the key facets of successful projects in the new context?</li>

<li>
What are the key facets of failing projects in the new context?</li>

<li>
What technologies are available (or required) to support development efforts?</li>

<li>
How will things evolve in the future?</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>

<h3>
Benefits</h3>
This session aims to achieve two goals: to set a conext and to define the
factors critical to the success of projects in this new world order.
<p>The context, it would be fair to say, has changed drastically from that
of even five years ago, yet it is not being taken into account - applications
are being written as though nothing has changes. The context gives us the
backdrop, the requirement, the problems which must be solved along the
way and, to a large extent, the solutions to these problems.
<p>Secondly, the definition of critical success factors for projects. This
is the domain of the methodology. Did eBay follow a methodology? Probably
not. Should we? At the top end, methodologies can be monolithic, bureaucratic,
largely unusable doctrines whose sole purpose is to wait for obsolescence.
There is clearly a middle ground, in which the needs of understanding and
usefulness are balanced with flexibility, and it is this point we should
strive for.
