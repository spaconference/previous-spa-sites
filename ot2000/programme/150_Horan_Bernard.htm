<h3>
The potential synergy between XML and Object Technology</h3></center>

<blockquote>Still in its infancy, XML seems poised to revolutionise the
web -- it can enable a multitude of IS functions: data warehousing; meta-data
definition; general three- or N-tier web-based application architectures;
document management; workflow, application integration. However, at first
sight, XML appears simply to be nothing more than a data definition language
-- the complete antithesis to the object approach of binding state and
behaviour.
<p>The purpose of the session is to explore the potential uses of a combination
of object-oriented technology and XML. Because XML is still in its infancy,
we have an opportunity to influence the standards to reflect more of an
object-oriented flavour. We hope that this session will bring together
a variety of experiences and insights that may contribute to the future
development and advancement of XML.</blockquote>

<h3>
Topics</h3>
The number and range of topics will be determined by the papers submitted.
However, we hope to cover such topics as:
<ul>
<li>
Practical experience of using XML and objects</li>

<li>
Architectures that support the integration of XML and objects</li>

<li>
Proposals for standard extensions to existing OO technology</li>

<li>
Proposals for tools</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>

<h3>
Benefits</h3>
Participants will learn from each other of the practical applications of
Objects and XML. In addition, participants will have the opportunity to
collaborate with their peers to revise and expand their papers and hopefully
create plans for future development.

<td><b>Audience:</b>
<br>Participants are expected to have participated in the application of
XML technology or have knowledge of how object-oriented technology could
be combined with XML. In particular, we expect that participants will understand
or have experience of one or more of the following: DTDs/schemas, XSLT
and FOP, how a DBMS can be used as an XML repository. Participants are
expected to contribute to discussion and to share their experiences. Participation
is by invitation only -- we invite papers from engineers, writers, architects
and anyone else with an interest in exploring what objects and XML can
do for you.</td>

<h3>
Material</h3>
Paper, post-its, posters, overhead transparencies, pens. We request papers
from interested participants. Possible topics for papers include: practical
experience of using XML and OT; how to improve the synergy between XML
and OT; proposed tools to combine XML and OT; proposed frameworks/components/architectures
to enable the synthesis of XML and OT. Papers should be approximately 500
words in length (about two sides of A4).
<h3>
Delivery</h3>
Participants will be encouraged to work together, their efforts facilitated
by the session leaders.
<h3>
Format</h3>
Working group format, with lots of opportunities to collaborate.
<h3>
Structure</h3>

<ol>
<li>
Intro by session leaders</li>

<li>
Participants divide into pairs and introduce themselves to each other/group</li>

<li>
Each pair discusses two papers (that they have NOT authored), and each
participant prepares a pr&eacute;cis of one of the two papers.</li>

<li>
Each participant presents a pr&eacute;cis of the paper s/he has read to
the group</li>

<li>
The members of the group divide into smaller teams to work on revising/combining/editing
the papers they have authored.</li>

<li>
The resulting papers are distributed among the group for a final review.</li>

<li>
Each paper is critiqued with suggestions for publication.</li>

<li>
Each participant writes down what s/he will do to continue the start they
have made in the session (this may include a continuation of the teams
during/after the conference).</li>
</ol>

<h3>
Outcomes</h3>
The revised papers; the intent to continue work on them; the impact on
participants' development practises; and the (implicit) learning about
new uses of XML and Objects.
