Sharing thoughts on the influence of Christopher Alexander</h3></center>

<center>
<h2>

<blockquote>The pattern work of Christopher Alexander, architect and controversial
thinker in the field of human use of space, has inspired similar thoughts
in the field of information systems. CA captured the imagination of a section
of the software development community. For some it was just inspiration,
for others a useful metaphor. But some do study his work, searching for
ideas that can help our community: improve design, analysis and organisation.
Is it hype, good commerce, or is there more to it. We will not decide about
that today, but we will have a closer look at less known work by Christopher
Alexander.
<p>Recently, C. Alexander worked to the concept of structure trying to
offer evidence that it is the basis of beauty; this complements his long-held
view that beauty and utility are inseparable (i.e., Ornament has Function).
The pattern community is exploring some isomorphic relevance of this theory
to software: how do patterns and centres map into the evolving structures
of software systems?

<td WIDTH="75%">Martine Devos is reuse and method consultant for EDS. She
was director of the IS-department at the Belgian department of education
(Argo) since 1992 and before has worked as teacher, as technical consultant
and project leader to the Belgian Minister of Education and the Civil Service.
As IS manager she introduced objects and she initiated, and co-ordinated
the development of a framework and several applications using it. Her main
focus is on the use of IS - and "softer software" - to support change programs
and learning. Special interests are framework development, the use of patterns
in organisation, the human side of IS and facilitating workshops. She participated
in, and organised, several workshops and panels on System Envisioning,
the use of creativity in requirements developing. She is program-chair
of EuroPlop 2000.</td>

<h3>
Topics</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Patterns and pattern languages</li>

<li>
"Quality without a name"</li>

<li>
Centres and structure preserving transformations</li>

<li>
Patterns in buildings, carpets and software</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>

<h3>
Extra</h3>
Jim Coplien will give a pub-talk about Nature of Order, the new work by
Christopher Alexander and introduce us to some of CA's experiment
<h3>
Benefits</h3>

<li>
Participants learn about and/or share ideas about Christopher Alexander's
works and ideas on patterns, pattern language and the theory of centers
(the "rug" book and Nature of Order).</li>

<li>
Participants will develop opinions about the applicability of the pattern
discipline at different levels of interpretation, ranging from the codification
of good practice to the relationship of geometry to beauty. We will also
explore avenues for potential new software development styles based on
those used in architecture, such as Construction On Site (as opposed to
Prefabricated Housing).</li>

<li>
They spend the Sunday afternoon looking around in Oxford, at carpets, reading
quotes from books and looking at software.</li>

<p><br>They are invited to this walk by a pattern user (and occasional
writer), "right-brainer" who gets more from Alexander than she wants to
admit on an ordinary weekday.
