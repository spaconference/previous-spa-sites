<P align=left><BLOCKQUOTE>			Workshop will try to distill out the essence of what needs to be 
			defined to fully describe a system requirement/design sufficiently
			for accurate construction of a successful system. The deliverables
			required will be identified. The process of achieving their definition
			will then be mapped, detailing the states through which the deliverables
			pass at each point. These deliverable/state combinations, taken as pre-
			requisites, yield an efficient minimalist process

<H3>Topics</H3><UL><LI> What constitutes a fully defined system?
<LI> What deliverables most efficiently encode this information?
<LI> What states do the deliverables move through in the lifecycle?
<LI> What are the deliverable/state dependencies?
<LI> Defining the minimalist process ito these deliverables 
			
<P>
</UL>
<H3>Benefits</H3><LI> Think about how methods can be optimally constructed to meet a 
			given need. 
<LI> Reduce the number of models produced and hence the project effort
<LI> Provide a small but effective method definition practitioners can
