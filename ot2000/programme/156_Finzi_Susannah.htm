<p><br>Stakeholder management enables the different members of a project
team or (more powerfully) different individuals in a supply chain to improve
their capability to work towards common goals. Stakeholder management is
collaborative management, in which we bring together the stakeholders around
a particular project and identify and acknowledge their differing perspectives.
The direct benefit of stakeholder management is in aligning the actions
of particular stakeholders towards their common goals.
<p>Stakeholder management activity builds trust between individuals as
well as sustainable capability in the organisation.
<p>The stakeholder game - the main component of this stakeholder management
master class -&nbsp; is designed to help people to experience stakeholder
management in a workshop environment and to relate it to current practice
in their own workplace. Participants in the master class take on stakeholder
roles in a case study.

since 1995. Prior to that he was a software engineering management consultant
with Coherent Technology, after an early career as a research consultant
in seismic geophysics.
<p>Aidan developed Antelope's Scimitar Risk Management System to allow
clients to achieve business objectives in the presence of risk. Unlike
most risk management approaches, Scimitar deals with the responsiveness
of the organisation and its management system rather than trying to quantify
the detailed risks.
<p>Aidan has led risk programmes to board level with organisations including
Tesco, BT MNS, Lloyds of London, Norwich Union Healthcare and Willis Corroon.</td>

<h3>
Benefits</h3>
The game gives participants the experience of how different individual
(stakeholder’s) perspective on an issue colours their understanding, the
solutions they seek and the actions they take, and how negotiation between
stakeholders can lead to greatly improved outcome.

<h4>
Delivery</h4>
Antelope Projects have designed versions of “stakeholder game” as part
of presentations at the British Deming Association, and to groups from
different organisations within the engineering, insurance, finance and
legal fields.
<p>The master class will be led by a principal of Antelope Projects (Susannah
Finzi or Aidan Ward)
<h4>
Format</h4>
Workshop.
<h4>
Structure</h4>
A brief presentation to position stakeholder management and the stakeholder
game..
<p>The “case” is outlined and the objectives identified.
<p>A brief brainstorm identifies some risks to the objectives.
<p>Divide into teams and assign roles. Prompted by questions from the session
leader
<p>- stakeholders within teams&nbsp; identify their different&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
positions/perspectives and
<br>- negotiate actions
<p>The output is stakeholder maps and action plans on flip charts – one
for each team - to which all stakeholders in the team have signed up.
