<blockquote>Traditionally object-oriented systems have tended to "hard
wire" together objects in hierarchies, through inheritance, and eventually
applications through collaborations and associations. This approach to
solutions engineering was effective when requirements were "stable" and
deployment was to a definable topology. The need to create distributed
systems, brought on in large part by the internet, along with the rise
in customer focused processing such as mass customization, portals and
"markets of one" have resulted in a need to create much looser couplings
between objects and components. This looser coupling is often achieved
through the use of components and script code, where the components reside
on many different nodes within and outside of an enterprise and the script
code may be dynamically generated based on user preferences.
<p>When the life span of a given system is measured not in decades but
in seconds, how best to capture and express the interactions that are planned
in the version 1.0 architecture of a solution?</blockquote>

technical leadership for the sizable annual investment Castek makes in
research and development. Mike's principle fields of interest are application

experience with CASE technology and has worked in all areas of the CASE
development life cycle. In his current role, he is working at incorporating
object technology principles into Castek's own component-based development
and their CBD/e consulting product. His primary area of interest is in
developing guidelines for the development of components based on the concepts
of business process, business objects, and data objects, the goal of which
is to develop business components that reflect the business and not the
prevailing technology and user interface. Kirby also enjoys contributing

ideas about component-based development.</td>

<h3>
Topics</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Portals, web applications, alternate computing devices and enterprise application
integration: What does the world look like that our brave little systems
have to cope with.</li>

<li>
Collaboration, Interaction, Joint Actions, What else?: How can we model
cross component/object behaviours and how best do we apply these techniques?</li>

<li>
To factor or not to factor: When do behaviours get factored to an interface
and when do they remain in the application code?</li>

<li>
How can we express a behaviour so that it may be realized in script? Can
we automate the generation of the script based on interaction rules? How
could we do that?</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Benefits</h4>
Participants in this session will have an opportunity to interact with
other practitioners and researchers who are focused on the topics of interaction
modeling, pattern and framework based generation and application deployment
in the age of the internet. This is an area of importance to software vendors
and business users as they look to post Y2K resurgence in application development
and deployment. Due to the topic, this session will be run as a highly
interactive and moderated brainstorming session.

<td><b>Audience:</b> This session is best suited for practitioners and
researchers interested in analysis and design notation and the creation
of distributed applications created with components. Anyone asking the
question "how do we design applications for the internet age that are responsive,
customizable and tailored to each individual user" would be a candidate
for attending and anyone who thinks they know the answer to that question
should attend.&nbsp;</td>

<h4>
Material</h4>
Since this is a real world problem we face in planning our applications,
we will prepare a case study outlining the problem as we see it. We will
also prepare a paper on what we perceive are the generally accepted way
of modeling interaction between objects and components and the short comings
we see in these techniques. These materials will help set the stage for
the discussions we hope to generate.
<h4>
Delivery</h4>
We will facilitate the session, and act as scribes to capture the thoughts
of the group. During the session conclusions we will seek to create a poster
detailing the major ideas generated by the session and as a follow-up exercise
we will produce a transcription of the session provided all participants
are willing to let us record the proceedings on magnetic tape.
<h4>
Format</h4>
This session will take the form of a think tank / brainstorming session,
with high user participation. We don't know the answer to this very real
world problem we face in our business, though we do have a lot of ideas.
We seek alignment with peers researching and exploring the same problem.
To reach alignment, we need to have a focused and highly participative
brainstorming session.
<h4>
Structure</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Level setting: Components and application architectures. 5 minutes.</li>

<li>
Established modeling techniques: What are the generally accepted ways of
expressing interaction between objects and components.&nbsp; As a group
we'll attempt to establish the applicability of these approaches to the
problem at hand.&nbsp; 25 minutes.</li>

<li>
Resolving the locality of the interaction: When does an interaction become
an operation and when does it remain at the "application level"?&nbsp;
Are there guidelines for this? 20 minutes.</li>

<li>
Additional techniques for refining the "application level" artifacts for
use in script or program code generation. 15 minutes.</li>

<li>
Final thoughts and conclusions. 10 minutes.</li>
</ul>
