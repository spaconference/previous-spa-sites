  <H1>Session formats</H1>
  The Software Practice Advancement conference has a tradition of active participation. 
  We encourage conference sessions that bring people together to work and learn 
  and in most cases, sessions are highly interactive, involving participants and 
  session leaders on an equal footing. The types of session that typically make 
  up the programme are described here, although if you are proposing a session 
  and want to do something different, we always welcome new suggestions. <BR>
  <BR>
  <A name=WS> 
  <H2>Workshop</H2>
  </A> 
  <H3>75 or 150 minutes</H3>
  Workshops are sessions in which participants work in a structured way on a topic 
  set by the workshop organiser. At the end of the workshop, the participants, 
  in conjunction with the workshop organiser, would normally produce and make 
  available to other participants some conclusions and, ideally, suggestions for 
  avenues worthy of further investigation. Workshops may take many different forms 
  and submitters are free to propose their own structure and process. It is very 
  important that proposals are explicit about the process that will be followed. 
  <BR>
  <BR>
  <A name=TU> 
  <H2>Tutorial</H2>
  </A> 
  <H3>75 or 150 minutes</H3>
  A tutorial consists of a presentation on a clearly focussed topic which is aimed 
  at a defined category of software professional. For example a tutorial could 
  be aimed at experienced project managers, or at professionals actively working 
  on object-oriented design projects. You should have a clear idea of what insights 
  your participants will take away, and why they will find these interesting. 
  While tutorials are expected to contain a certain amount of formal lecturing, 
  you should try to incorporate a degree of interaction between participants, 
  for example by including a quiz or questionnaire. <BR>
  <BR>
  <A name=GB> 
  <H2>Goldfish Bowl</H2>
  </A> 
  <H3>75 or 150 minutes</H3>
  A goldfish bowl provides an effective means of exploring the breadth of opinion 
  on a given topic. The session is started by a small discussion group (say four 
  or five people) consisting of specially invited participants, with the rest 
  of the participants forming an audience. Spare places in the discussion group 
  are available, and members of the audience may take up these places when they 
  feel they have a contribution to make. Members of the discussion group leave 
  their places when they have had their say, making room for new participants. 
  The session should produce documentary output of the conclusions reached, typically 
  in the form of a poster. <BR>
  <BR>
  <A name=CS> 
  <H2>Case Study</H2>
  </A> 
  <H3>75 or 150 minutes</H3>
  A case study session aims to describe real-life experiences and lessons learnt 
  in implementing object technology. Discussion of failures as well as successes 
  is welcome. The experiences described can be drawn from any aspect of object 
  technology projects. Useful topics to address in a case study session would 
  be: background to why object technology was used; report on the experience of 
  using object technology; what went wrong and why; what went well and why; what 
  lessons have been learnt from the experience. <BR>
  <BR>
  <A name=SI> 
  <H2>Simulation</H2>
  </A> 
  <H3>75 or 150 minutes</H3>
  Given the complexity of the real-world environment in which we practice software, 
  it is often not possible to reflect clearly on the way we work or to expweriment 
  with new approaches. Using simulations and games howwever allows us to think 
  about these situations with increased clarity. A simulation leader will be responsible 
  for producing a clear and concise summary of the purpose, rules, and assumptions 
  of the game. Some work on reflecting on the results of the game and its implications 
  for real-world practice should also be included. The output from the sessions 
  is likely to include both summary results from the simulation and a summary 
  of its real-world implications. <BR>
  <BR>
  <A name=TT> 
  <H2>Think Tank</H2>
  </A> 
  <H3>75 or 150 minutes</H3>
  A think-tank session consists of a small group of people meeting to solve a 
  particular problem or to find an agreed position on some issue. Think-tank sessions 
  are intensive, focused and produce concrete output in the form of a poster for 
  other conference participants. The session leader is responsible for the process 
  of the session, for any materials that may be needed, and for ensuring that 
  the poster is produced. <BR>
  <BR>
  <A name=WG> 
  <H2>Working Group</H2>
  </A> 
  <H3>6 hours</H3>
  A working group is formed to conduct a detailed exploration of some aspect of 
  object technology, to identify how that aspect of the technology can be advanced, 
  and then to put in motion the work needed to achieve this advance. Working groups 
  are run to encourage the exchange of ideas between object technology practitioners 
  with the aim of generating or encouraging progress that is applicable to the 
  software community at large. A leader of a working group may require some pre-conference 
  input from participants (submission of a position paper or preparation of a 
  pattern for review, for example). <BR>
  <BR>
  Formal working group sessions take place on Sunday afternoon, before the main 
  part of the conference. Groups may continue to meet during and after the conference
