  hour on Sundays, and twice an hour during the working week. The journey takes 
  50 minutes. For details of services, please telephone National Rail Enquiries

  or <a href="http://www.wagn.co.uk" target="_blank">http://www.wagn.co.uk</a> </p> 
  <p>A taxi service (Anglian Taxis - 01480 475222) is available from St. Neots 
    station to The Robinson Centre (approximately 10 minutes ride), but they usually 
    only have a skeleton service on Sunday morning/early afternoon. If you are 
    planning to arrive by train, please email <a href="mailto:admin@spaconference.org">admin@spaconference.org</a>
