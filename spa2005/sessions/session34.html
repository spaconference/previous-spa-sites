	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">The use of natural language narrative for capturing needs and designs is encouraged both in scenario-based development and in XP (stories).  <br />
<br />
The great thing about narrative is that readers bring so much knowledge to the process of filling in the gaps in understanding it, without even realising it, leading to design artefacts that are not crammed with verbiage and can be engaged with.  The dangerous thing about narrative is that readers may fill in the gaps, without even realising it, and might accept promises you did not even know you had made.  Both fiction readers and stakeholders regularly believe six impossible things before breakfast.<br />
<br />
This workshop will look for lessons for writing good scenarios from both the literature about narrative and the related experiences of the participants.<br />

<br />
And perhaps ...<br />
<br />
* Ideas for effectively linking scenarios by character, event or design object, to make dependencies clear for stakeholders, thus breaking out of use case silos.<br />
<br />
* Ideas for educating stakeholders to be effective scenario readers.  (After all, we learn how to read different kinds of fiction.)<br />

00:30 - 01:00; new subgroups will consider these candidate practices in the light of their own experiences of using XP stories or scenario-based design, and of specially constructed examples and counter-examples.<br />

01:00 - 01:15: the subgroups will introduce their selection from their work, in anticipation of their appearance on the session web pages.<br />
