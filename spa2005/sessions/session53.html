	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">In object oriented software, business logic is encapsulated in business objects. However, implementation requirements can obscure this clean encapsulation. Beside  the business logic itself, many objects also contain code such as logging statements, which do not belong to the business logic. This tangles the code, which makes it more difficult to understand, maintain and reuse. AOP addresses this problem by moving the implementation aspects out of the business objects. Tools to implement AOP for several programming languages have been introduced.<br />
<br />
This session gives a short summary of the ideas and terminology of AOP in general  and the implementation of Aspects for Java. An overview of four different AOP tools for Java is given, discussing the implementation used in the tools and their  advantages and disadvantages for various kinds of software projects.<br />
<br />
In the subsequent practical, the participants explore up to four different AOP tools using worked examples. For each of the four tools, the mode of operation is explained using a single slide. Each participant then has time to explore and complete the example using one of the tools. Prepared examples using ant scripts will be provided.</td></tr>

At least one participant in each group (see below) should bring their own laptop with JDK 1.4.2, Java 5 and Apache Ant installed.</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Benefits of participating:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">* Come away with basic knowledge about available AOP tools for Java and some  sample code<br />
<br />
* A deeper understanding of how different AOP tools for Java work and which of them might be interesting for future use in a project<br />
<br />
* First practical experience with an AOP tool</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">* Introduce the objectives of the session<br />
<br />
* Present the basic ideas and terminologies for AOP<br />
<br />
* Explain the basic technology of how AOP can be implemented for Java<br />
<br />
* Discuss four available tools. For each tool, a summary shows how aspects are  implemented, which artifacts are used and how the aspects are implemented  from definition to runnable code.<br />
<br />
* Present a summary of the tools discussed, including advantages and  disadvantages<br />
<br />
* Sum up by outlining again the objectives of the session and naming the ways in which they have been addressed<br />
<br />
* Ask the audience for their views and take questions, if time remains<br />
<br />
* Introduction to the practical<br />
<br />
* Split the participants up into groups (individuals is possible as well). Each group starts using one of the four tools to make first experiences. If enough time is left, a second tool can be used. While using the tool, each group lists questions, remarks, positive and negative points about the tool<br />
<br />
* The important lessons learned, questions and remarks are briefly presented by each group at the end of the tutorial<br />
