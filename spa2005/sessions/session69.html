	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">SOA is the latest system-structuring paradigm to be foisted on software architects.  At present, it is difficult to read a contemporary software industry periodical or web site without reading about the benefits of the SOA approach. <br />
<br />
There is a growing body of opinion that SOA based document/process oriented applications are more flexible, for example see http://www.ftponline.com/ea/magazine/fall/online/avernet/default_pf.aspx . <br />
<br />
But there is also still much debate on how this fits with existing application development techniques and the wider issue of whether SOA represents a universal new architectural paradigm, for example see http://www.cbronline.com/content/COMP/Magazine/Articles/Features/ServiceatYourDiscretion.asp .<br />
<br />
So what is a “service”, what is a “service oriented architecture”, and why should we be interested using them? This workshop will allow its participants to analyse the service-oriented approach to system development, both in the abstract and via concrete exercises.</td></tr>

<br />
· An appreciation of the issues in pinning down the definition of “service” as it used in the context of SOA.<br />
· An appreciation of some of the issues of designing an SOA architecture that leverages the data and functionality of existing systems. <br />
· An opportunity to share experiences on how widely applicable the SOA approach really is, and whether expectations of benefits are realistic.</td></tr>

· Example system for deciding on the suitability of applications for SOA (Exercise 1).<br />
· Example architecture as the basis for wrapping legacy-based systems as services (Exercise 2).</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">1. Introductory presentation, providing background on the concepts of SOA and providing the presenters’ views of what a service is and the benefits that may, or may not, be obtained. A bit on technology – at least sufficient to differentiate SOA from Web Services.<br />
2. Divide the participants into 3 groups for exercises.<br />
3. Exercise 1: SOA or not SOA?  The groups are given views of an existing enterprise system/application (could be the same system for each group or different ones depending on how much work we want!) with a “traditional” architecture (e.g. n-tier layered client/server). Participants work in their small groups to identify potential services within the application structure, whether the application would suit itself to using services, and what the benefits of restructuring to a service based architecture might be.<br />
4. Group Presentations: Each group presents their conclusions about whether their system seemed suited to SOA. If so, what would the services be and what would the new architecture look like? If not, why not?<br />
5. Presentation: Doing SOA. Re-visit the concept of SOA as a way of wrapping existing enterprise systems. <br />
6. Exercise 2: It’s a Wrap.  The groups are given a description of an existing legacy architecture and a set of requirements to build a set of services using its data and functionality. Each group should come up with a proposed new service based architecture and a set of issues that must be confronted to make this architecture work.<br />
7. Group Presentations: the two groups present their architectures and the issues related to its creation. Issues and thoughts are collected by presenters as the presentations are given.<br />
8. Wrap-up: review of collated thoughts from second set of presentations.<br />
