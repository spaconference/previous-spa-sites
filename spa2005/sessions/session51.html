<br />
The session will begin by presenting three contrasting code examples, each achieving the same objective in different ways. These examples will form the basis of a discussion on what makes readable code. Focusing on one of the examples, the group will discuss how they might refactor it into a self-documenting structure.<br />
<br />
During this group discussion, the workshop leader will use the examples to define and motivate self-documenting code. He will then propose and demonstrate several techniques for achieving it.<br />
<br />
Having discussed some basic theory, the interactive refactoring exercise will begin. Attendees will work in pairs, writing code either on a piece of paper - since it does not have to run - or on a laptop, according to their preference. The exercise will be to refactor the code into a more readable form that is as self-documenting as possible.<br />
<br />
Once the code is written, each pairs will share their code with another pair. The pairs will then be able to exchange initial impressions of the refactored code and opportunities for improvement.<br />
<br />
Finally, the group will discuss insights they have gained from the process, with a focus on practical steps that will facilitate self-documenting code.</td></tr>

- Thesauri will be provided during the refactoring exercise, since one of the techniques to be discussed is the use of a thesaurus.<br />
- Participants may bring a laptop to refactor the provided examples. Alternatively, it is fine to perform the exercises on paper if they wish.</td></tr>
