	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Project culture and organization can have as big, if not bigger, influence on the success of a project than the method, language or platform used for a project. For example:<br />
- configuration management: How do you work with it, what is controlled there, branching, testing;<br />
- file structure: How do you organize all your stuff, or your source, how does this match with your tools;<br />
- documentation: What is being documented, how is that done, what is avoided, what is helpful;<br />
- meetings: For what purposes do you meet with whom, how often and long, how do these meetings look like;<br />
- daily schedule: Do you plan for lunch with colleagues, private thinking time;<br />
- rooms. How is your team seated, how does this work;<br />
- team: how is the work divided, how are individuals measured and rewarded.<br />
<br />
This session is intended to be a workshop to discover the impact of project culture and organization on project success (or failure) and to document heuristics for elements of project culture and organization discovered during the workshop.<br />

<br />
00:00 - 00:15 Introduction:<br />
<br />
    00:00 - 00:15 State the purpose of the session, provide an introduction to possible areas of interest and note the current state of literature covering subject.<br />
<br />
00:15 - 00:50 Gathering and filtering audience's experience:<br />
<br />
    00:15 - 00:35 Brainstorm, to mine the audience's experience of project culture/organization, in particular those elements that have caused difficulty on a project or have changed with positive effect.<br />
<br />
    00:35 - 00:50 a filtering exercise on the Brainstorm to concentrate on a small number of project culture/organization elements, the number of subjects put forward for further exploration will depend on the size of the audience (and the resultant number of teams).<br />
<br />
00:50 - 01:00 Break<br />
<br />
01:00 - 01:55 Defining heuristics:<br />
<br />
For a larger audience:<br />
<br />
    01:00 - 01:30 Teams will be chosen and then the teams will elaborate the subjects chosen during the filtering process resulting in an outline set of heuristics.<br />
<br />
        Identify the good and bad elements.<br />
<br />
        How to recognize these elements, looking for symptoms, both positive and negative.<br />
<br />
        What actions can be taken to correct bad elements of culture/organization, how to replace something negative with something positive.<br />
<br />
    01:30 - 01:55 Presentation of the elaboration exercise and Heuristics to the group by the teams, this will provoke more discussion and so will add to those areas already elaborated.<br />
<br />
For a smaller audience:<br />
<br />
    01:00 - 01:55 The subjects will be elaborated and discussed as a single team resulting in an outline set of heuristics.<br />
<br />
01:55 - 02:05 Break<br />
<br />
02:05 - 02:20 Render the subject elaboration into checklists or patterns (this depending on the nature and experience of the audience and the output achieved).<br />
<br />
02:20 - 02:30: Session wrap-up and collection of materials.<br />
<br />
Contingency: Additional tasks (if time available during the workshop):<br />
<br />
- Identify patterns in the session outputs<br />
- Create a pattern language for the elements of project culture discussed.<br />
- Detail each pattern with the source and heuristics from the session.<br />
- Detail corrective actions for the bad patterns.</td></tr>
