Your relationship with your colleagues may have changed and cranking out code just doesn't cut it any more. You probably have to underwrite the quality of the system being produced and the team needs to deliver on time. <br />
<br />
Do you sleep well at night? Well maybe you shouldn't. This tutorial will discuss some of the reasons you should be laying awake worrying about delivery. It will go on to discuss some tried and tested techniques for ensuring that if you wake up with a feeling of impending doom that you can drift back to sleep, safe that things are under a degree of control or can be brought back on track. <br />
<br />
The subject matter is broad but we'll cover 10 key practices from the full range of team leading activities including: <br />
* Transition to team lead.<br />
* Managing 'upwards' and 'sideways'.<br />
* Getting decisions adopted and socialised. <br />
* Worry Patterns--signs not to be ignored. <br />
...and more. <br />
<br />
We'll draw examples from both the presenters experience and those in the group. </td></tr>

They'll have learnt some warning signs they need to watch for and some techniques for addressing the warning signs before they become a problem. They'll have formed a more rounded view on Team Leadership and will have added some tools to the personal Team Lead toolkit.</td></tr>
