	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">SOA is the latest system-structuring paradigm to be foisted on software architects.  At present, it is difficult to read a contemporary software industry periodical or web site without reading about the benefits of the SOA approach.<br />
 <br />
There is a growing body of opinion that SOA based document/process oriented applications are more flexible, for example see http://www.ftponline.com/ea/magazine/fall/online/avernet/default_pf.aspx . But there is also still much debate on how this fits with existing application development techniques and the wider issue of whether SOA represents a universal new architectural paradigm, for example see http://www.cbronline.com/content/COMP/Magazine/Articles/Features/ServiceatYourDiscretion.asp .<br />
<br />
So what is a “service”, what is a “service oriented architecture”, and why should we be interested using them? This workshop will allow its participants to analyse the service-oriented approach to system development, both in the abstract and via concrete exercises.<br />

* An appreciation of some of the issues of designing an SOA architecture that leverages the data and functionality of existing systems. <br />
* An opportunity to share experiences on how widely applicable the SOA approach really is, and whether expectations of benefits are realistic.<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">1.	Introductory presentation, providing background on the concepts of SOA and providing the presenters’ views of what a service is and the benefits that may, or may not, be obtained. A bit on technology – at least sufficient to differentiate SOA from Web Services.<br />
2.	Presentation: Doing SOA. Examine SOA as a way of thinking about the relationship between business and IT structures. <br />
3.	Divide the participants into groups for exercises.<br />
4.	Exercise 1: SOA or not SOA?  The groups are given views of an existing enterprise with a “traditional” architecture. Participants work in their groups to define a suitable service structure, and propose what the benefits of restructuring to a service based architecture might be.<br />
5.	Group Presentations: Each group presents their conclusions about whether their system seems suited to SOA, what the services might and the potential benefits.<br />
6.	Exercise 2: It’s the Business.  The groups build on the service definitions by defining service interfaces and show how the services support a business scenario.<br />
7.	Group Presentations: the groups show how their services support the business scenario. Issues and thoughts are collected by presenters as the presentations are given.<br />
8.	Wrap-up: review of collated thoughts from second set of presentations.<br />
