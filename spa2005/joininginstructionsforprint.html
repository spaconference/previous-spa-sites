  50 minutes. For details of services, please telephone National Rail Enquiries

  or http://www.wagn.co.uk </p> 
  <p>A taxi service (Anglian Taxis - 01480 475222) is available from St. Neots 
    station to The Robinson Centre (approximately 10 minutes ride), but they usually 
    only have a skeleton service on Sunday morning/early afternoon. If you are 
    planning to arrive by train, please email admin@spaconference.org with anticipated 
    time of arrival and we will ask the taxi firm to ensure they have enough drivers 
    to meet the trains.</p>
