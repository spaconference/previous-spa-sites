	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">In September 2014 Computing was made a "proper subject" in schools across the country meaning children as young as 4 are learning computing skills in the classroom. Programmes like the Young Rewired State Festival of Code mean that young people are leaving school with a ready made network of tech industry contacts. This workshop aims to show you what it is like to be studying Computing at school as a young person today, inform you about the places you can support and nurture the nation's youth, from all walks of life, in their coding endeavours by getting some hands on development with some of the most popular tools - AppInventor and Ratchet (no Scratch however!).</td></tr>
