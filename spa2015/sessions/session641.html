	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">In this session, participants implement tickets for a humanitarian open source software project. <br />
<br />
Candidate projects are OpenMRS (http://openmrs.org/) and MifosX (http://mifos.org/mifos‐x/). OpenMRS is a system to capture and process medical records and contributes to improving medical care. MifosX  is a platform for providing microfinance services and makes financial products available to people without access to conventional commercial banking. Both systems have been set up as open source software and are developed by a large community.<br />
<br />
After a brief introduction and setting their development environment, participants spent the better part of four hours building working software for a good cause. The session is fun and mind-opening: whilst coding away (the fun part) people learn about an aspect of software development that is very different from most of our daytime jobs (the mind-opening part).  </td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Audience background:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">As the session is a code jam, the majority of participants should come from an active software development background. The tech stack of both OpenMRS and MifosX is based on Java, Spring, Hibernate and MySQL. BA and QA people are also invited to join the session.</td></tr>

The session raises awareness that everybody can contribute to a better world by cutting some code. Participants are encouraged to spread the word and run code jams for humanitarian software themselves.</td></tr>

<br />
After setting up their development environment, participants choose a ticket to work on. To facilitate the choice of a topic to work on, the session lead reserves a few tickets for the workshop. <br />
<br />
Alternatively, participants can look for a suitable ticket from the respective project themselves. Participants are encouraged to work in pairs.</td></tr>
