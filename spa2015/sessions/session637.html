	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Test-Driven Development is desperately simple. Simple, because it takes about five minutes to understand the principles. Desperately, because real-life contexts seem always harder than case studies used for training -- at least by forty-two orders of magnitude.<br />
<br />
Just for laughs, we'll aim this time at doing the opposite (to practice TDD in a more difficult context than the typical workplace) and we'll show how we can use TDD to build a non-trivial shader in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language). This tutorial is intended to push the limits of<br />
what is considered doable with TDD. By doing so, we hope to make the audience realize that if it's possible to test-drive code in GLSL, it should be possible to do so in virtually any TDD-resistant environment.<br />
<br />
This is a performative programming session: the audience will watch a performer programming for its (the audience's) benefit some non-trivial piece of code from A to Z.  In the spirit of the Brechtian theatre, the audience is encouraged to laugh at the misery of the programmer on the stage, to be critical of their (the programmer's) successes, to cheer and to boo, to smoke and to eat, and to think about what they'd do (better) if they were in the same position.</td></tr>

what TDD is, and a practical experience at programming software.  Knowledge of<br />
non-aristotelian drama theory isn't required.<br />
