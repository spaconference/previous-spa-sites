	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">What's the differentiating factor between high achievers and those who repeatedly fail to reach their goals? What is that keeps us pursuing our dreams when others would have long given up?<br />
<br />
As mankind has evolved, we've become more conscious and informed of who we are and how our minds work. This has led to profound insights on the concept of Hope. Instead of being a mere emotion, the latest research shows us Hope is a process and a thinking tool that can help us harness our willpower and come up with ways to make our dreams come true.<br />
<br />
Join us in this fun and interactive talk to better understand your relationship with Hope and figure out how to achieve even your most ambitious of goals, at work and outside of work.<br />
<br />

It will be presented in the format of a 45-minute interactive talk at QCon London in March 2015. My proposal for SPA is to run it as a workshop so it will be substantially different to the talk format. At SPA, I plan to incorporate different exercises to really practice "hopeful thinking" and explore its effectiveness.</td></tr>
