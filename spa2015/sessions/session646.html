	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">In theory the idea of baby step refactoring in order to keep the code compilable and the tests green is pretty simple.<br />
<br />
The practice is much harder. Some less commonly known refactoring techniques are necessary in order to emerge a clean object-oriented design step by step from typical spaghetti code suffering from procedural character, entangled responsibilities and high coupling.<br />
<br />
We'll start with a small application that has the domain logic together with user interaction and file IO implemented in a single large method. From there we are going to untangle responsibilities, separate concerns, emerge domain objects and learn refactoring techniques like parallel change, narrow change, loop splitting and duplicate&reduce on the way.<br />
<br />
We will end up with seven well focused classes and hopefully can say that the code was never uncompilable for more than a few seconds at once on the way.<br />
<br />
And of course, there are tests, that should never become red. ;-)<br />

But developers who refactor in baby step probably live much longer as they are not shot down by the 100 red tests when the code becomes finally compilable again after hours of refactoring shoot-out. </td></tr>
