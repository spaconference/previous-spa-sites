<br />
The last 125 years (roughly) saw the rise of Scientific Management: The idea that organisations should have managers who tell people how to work. This approach has many drawbacks and limitations, not the lease of which is it sucks! People hate it, and turn up to work with no motivation. <br />
<br />
A more modern mindset to structuring work can be seen in how Agile teams run. Not only do these teams often produce better quality work, and sooner, they have more fun and are more motivated while they do so! This approach doesn't need to be limited to software teams, or teams where continuous delivery makes sense. Entire organisations can run this way!<br />
<br />
This workshop will involve a number of practical hands on exercises to help participants really understand the difference in mindsets. It will involve participants forming into small groups and attempting tasks using several different models of organisation.<br />
<br />
By the end of it, participants will have a clear and deep understanding of the different mindsets, and some practical ides they can use (should they wish to) to teach their colleagues about the new mindset.</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Benefits of participating:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">A deep understanding of how to tell if an organisation is using any parts of the new mindset. This can be helpful either in identifying jobs that fit with the participants desires (if they are looking for a new role) or practical specific ideas on how to initiate change in their current job</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">The session will involve an introduction talking about the two predominant mindsets, before introducing practical exercises that give the participants the chance to experience the realities of working in these different styles. Between each exercise there will be a debrief and a discussion to allow the group to come to their own conclusions about the benefits and drawbacks of each approach</td></tr>
