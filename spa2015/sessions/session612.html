<br />
When your services integrate with those of other teams, the integration phase is only as fast as its slowest activity - typically, manual regression testing. Queues form as teams wait to get their work into the next release. Similarly, if you own a large number of services, testing and deploying them together leads to undesirable batching effects.<br />
<br />
To go faster, teams may seek to promote and release each component independently. But how can they be sure that service versions will interoperate if they haven't been tested together?<br />
<br />
Fast, lightweight "contract tests" capture the implicit agreements between services and consumers. They decouple the delivery activities of collaborating teams without losing the feedback loops that alert us to integration problems.<br />
<br />
In this talk, I'll share my experiences and we'll see how we can get features out quickly, without sacrificing quality.</td></tr>

Understand the options you have for where to apply contract tests. Appreciate the costs involved in contract testing. Get an appraisal of some of the tools in the space. Understand in which contexts you should/should not use contract tests.</td></tr>
