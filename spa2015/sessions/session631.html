	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Nowadays all software developers need to be aware of threats to web based systems, not just those who work for Facebook.  With nearly all systems having a web interface of some sort and the common attack vectors for these systems being well known, it's not just cybercriminals, Anonymous or the NSA who are the primary threat, but Alice in Accounts.  However while we've ve all heard of a cross-site scripting attack, what does the vulnerable code look like and how do we fix it?<br />
<br />
In this session we will review the top 10 list of threats to web based systems and perform some of the attacks ourselves. We will then inspect the vulnerable code and fix it to repel the attack.  In so doing attendees will get to delve into what each vulnerability looks like, understand how they can be mitigated and learn how to harden web-based systems to protect them against attacks.<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">The workshop is based on the process of introducing the subject to confirm or provide base knowledge and then having the attendees explore the problem space via guided exercises to learn by doing.<br />
<br />
- An initial short presentation reviews the fundamentals of IT security and sets some context by defining terms like threat, attack, attacker, mitigation, and mechanism.<br />
<br />
- A second part of the presentation introduces the OWASP Top 10 list of web application vulnerabilities, briefly describing each.<br />
<br />
- For the rest of the session attendees will choose a couple of the items from the list and use a deliberately vulnerable application to investigate each by performing the attack, reviewing the vulnerability, fixing the vulnerability and attacking the application again to prove that it is resolved.<br />
<br />
- Attendees will be encouraged to work in pairs to investigate the vulnerabilities.<br />
<br />
- The attendees can take away the working environment and so can continue to investigate vulnerabilities after the session if they are interested in doing so.<br />
