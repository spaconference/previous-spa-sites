	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Those who work in software development are all too familiar that it is hard to get customers’ requirements right first time every time. The processes and tools that we currently use only capture the functional and overlook emotional needs of the customer. This is where design thinking approach is more suited. The value of asking interesting questions is a central tenant of design thinking. Design thinking is an approach that is human-centred, possibility-driven, option-focused and iterative by running experiments with the users instead of analysis of historic data to craft solutions. It is a way of approaching a challenge that offers another skillset that is complementary to other forms of thinking for product development. <br />
<br />
This is a first stab of the approach to be used in anger for problem solving in a conference setting. Participants will be working through two of the four stages of design thinking using tools such as journey mapping (observation and question/answer) and mind mapping during the ‘what is’ stage and brainstorming and concept development during ‘what-if’ stage, for idea generation. If time allows idea validation and assumption testing will be carried out in whole class setting. <br />
<br />
The familiar example of holiday planning  is chosen for the workshop. Throughout the workshop, participants are encouraged to use visualisation technique such as sketching, post-it and photo cuttings. Magic whiteboard sheets and pens will be provided to facilitate that.<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">The workshop is based on processes and techniques as described in Jeanne Liedtka book on Designing for Growth. The first two stages are selected because of time constraints. The participants would work in groups of 3 for journey and mind mapping in the first half of the workshop. This stage as described in the book is called ‘what is’ stage to establish current reality. During this part, they will identify 7-10 key touch(pain) points through observation and interviewing. These will be explored in the second half of the workshop to generate ideas during the brainstorming.  These will form the basis of concept development. There will be review throughout to share experiences between teams. <br />
<br />
The participants will role play as user, observer and interviewer in the first half. They will be encouraged to take pictures, record conversation and cuttings from brochure provided in support of their work. A holiday booking url will be provided that participant can use as a guide to enhance their experience in ethnographic research approach<br />
