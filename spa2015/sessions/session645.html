<br />
Sprint planning, at times, can be boring, uninteresting and stressful. Now you can make it more interesting and visual by attending the workshop details of which are given below. This is a fun way of learning to draw and take sketchnotes while planning at the same time<br />
<br />
Sketchnote taking is your flexible friend for drawing your plans that takes you along the path of turning ideas into reality. Its iterative nature gives you flexibility to create, move, add, delete and to refine ideas as plans develop. It gives visual representation of plan elements such as tasks, dates, people (personas), discussions and reference material and adds a different perspective that reveals patterns not thought of before.  You can zoom in and out from overview to details from the same sketchnote. You can embed familiar visual elements such as icons, typography and containers (frames) as you create a plan that is good tool amongst the team to communicate with<br />
<br />
The workshop introduces visual language and 12 devices that make up the sketchnotes. An example is used as activities are created, added, changed, deleted and progressed through sprint cycle. It is a fun workshop where attendees work in groups creating visuals for the sprint plan and practice visual language for creative sketchnote taking <br />
The workshop aims to build visual skills vital for developers to communicate ideas clearly<br />
