	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">It's not always easy to know which test to write next in TDD and some problems make this harder than others. In this session I will introduce you to a small problem that I find often causes difficulty. We'll work through this in pairs and do a retrospective on why it was hard to TDD (or what you did if you found it easy). <br />
<br />
Then I'll introduce you to a way that I've been practicing that I've been calling "test recycling". I'll ask you to try the problem again using this technique, and we'll do another retrospective to compare. <br />
<br />
I hope to add a new technique to your TDD toolbox and learn new techniques from you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Rationale:<br />
TDD is hard to teach and hard to learn. This workshop aims to discover if by relaxing one of the implicit restrictions in the TDD mantra (write a failing test, get test to pass, refactor) this becomes easier.<br />
<br />
It is my belief that test recycling leads to looser coupled tests, that more naturally specify behaviour rather than implementation details. I hope this session will give feedback on this belief.<br />
<br />
"Recycling" - modifies the first step of the traditional TDD cycle from "Write a failing test" to "Write a failing test or modify an existing test". I have found that this helps in situations where people find the next step hard to identify.<br />
<br />
Objectives:<br />
Goals of the session.<br />
â�¢ Get consensus about whether this is a useful technique<br />
â�¢ Refine description and motivation of technique<br />
â�¢ Identify other techniques during first retrospective (and write them up if appropriate)</td></tr>

00:00 - 00:20 Short introduction to recycling & kata<br />
00:20 - 01:00 Pairs use traditional TDD and/or recycling to develop a solution to the kata<br />
01:00 - 01:15 Retrospective<br />
01:15 - 01:30 Demonstration of a recycled approach<br />
01:30 - 02:00 Pairs redo kata using recycling<br />
02:00 - 02:20 Retrospective & alternative approaches<br />
02.15 - 02:30 Wrap up & write up<br />

By limiting discussion and removing the second kata this session could be delivered in 75 minutes.</td></tr>
