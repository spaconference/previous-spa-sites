	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">We're going to explore the main ideas underpinning distributed, highly available databases - in particular the sorts of databases that are heavily inspired by the ideas in the Dynamo Paper (http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf) such as Riak and Cassandra. So we'll cover things like:<br />
<br />
* what availability and consistency are and how you can trade them off for each other<br />
* how to carry on reading and writing in the face of node failures<br />
* eventual consistency and repairs<br />
<br />
Then we'll try out these ideas by building our own simple distributed data store on top of a bunch of in-memory hash-maps, and see what happens when we wreak havoc by simulating node failures.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Audience background:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Developers who are interested in learning more about dynamo-like distributed databases.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Benefits of participating:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">A familiarity with the main ideas underlying dynamo-like database distribution, that will come in handy when using or considering using these sorts of databases in the future.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Materials provided:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">I'll provide links to the slides, and a github repo that has:<br />
<br />
a) an implementation of a hashmap wrapped in a simple HTTP API, which can be used as a single node in the distributed system<br />
<br />
b) a clear lists of tasks to build upon when creating the database yourself. (will include a hint sheet too - with code snippets for those who get very stuck)</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">First I'll present the ideas, and then I'll present how we're going to code our own version. This'll be outlined as a series of tasks that build upon each other. Then people can program on their own or in groups to get through the tasks, and I'll go around trying to help!</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Detailed timetable:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Not sure how long a session should be. Maybe 45mins presentation, 15mins exercise explanation, 90-120mins for the exercise?</td></tr>
