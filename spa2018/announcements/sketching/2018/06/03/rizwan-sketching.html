      <p>Sketching is an easily overlooked skill for developers and everyone else, yet the benefits that sketching brings cannot be overstated. Many of us feel that we weren’t born with artistic talent and so we try to avoid it as much as possible.</p>

<p>Perhaps we’re making a big mistake, though. Rizwan Javaid claims we can all become skilled sketchers and he will be <a href="/spa2018/sessions/session768.html">teaching us</a> how at SPA Software in Practice 2018.</p>

<p><img src="/spa2018/images/2018/rizwan_banner.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Rizwan Javaid" /></p>

<p>Shortly after trying to sketch a car which ended up looking like two cardboard boxes floating above eggs, we met up with the affable Rizwan to find out how we can become better sketchers and what we can look forward to in his session at SPA.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Hello Rizwan. We’re delighted to have you at SPA 2018. But be honest, do you really believe anyone can sketch?</strong></p>

<p>Hi, yes, I truly believe that everyone can sketch. There is a common misconception that only creative people or designers can sketch. If you can draw basic shapes such as lines,  circles, squares, and rectangles, then I have great news for you. You can sketch!</p>

<p><strong>Q: In your session at SPA, how will you teach us to become sketching machines?</strong></p>

<p>In my session, I share why sketching is important to ideate, iterate, and communicate ideas and then we jump right into quick, fun, and challenging sketching exercises. I want my audience to feel the power of sketching firsthand and what better way to do this than by actually sketching.</p>

<p><strong>Q: And when we return to our jobs after SPA, how will we use our new sketching superpowers?</strong></p>

<p>The beauty of this session is that you will be able to apply what you have learned right away. In fact, you don’t even have to wait to get back to work. You can even begin your transformation to a sketching machine on your commute home. Unless you’re driving then definitely don’t sketch while driving.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What else can we look forward to in your session?</strong></p>

<p>For the brave souls that get through the sketching exercises I will also be sharing some tips along the way to help you supercharge your way to becoming a sketching machine. I will also share supplies and books that have helped me in my sketching machine journey.</p>

<p><strong>Q: For those of us who can’t wait for your session, what tips can you give us to become better at sketching?</strong></p>

<p>You know good things come to those who wait but we can overlook that for today. When it comes to sketching, consistency is the key. Start out small by finding just 5 minutes in your day to sketch. Make a list of things you are interested in sketching and sketch them for the 5 short minutes. Now make it a  goal to keep sketching every day for 5 minutes. Small actions done daily help create our habits. The small investment in time will yield exponential rewards in your approach to sketching and you will supercharge your journey to becoming a sketching machine</p>

<p>Tickets for SPA conference are <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/spa2018-tickets-42752231074">now available</a>. We’d love you to join us and we’re sure you’d love the company of SPA’s friendly and vibrant community.</p>
