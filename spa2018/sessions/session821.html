<h1>The Virtuous Technologist</h1>
<p>How the Enlightenment failed to provide Technologists any guidance on Ethics, and how a more classical approach might yet save us</p>

<p><em>150 mins - mix of presentation</em></p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>How ought we to act? How might we flourish and live well, contributing positively to society?<br />
<br />
Why is it that Technologists struggle with answering these most basic Ethical questions ? Why is it that there is no coherent or largely adopted approach ? Should we abandon all hope of ever finding an Ethical approach to Technology, or is there a different approach that might provide us some possibilities?<br />
<br />
This session is aimed at educating the audience about a pre-Enlightenment approach to Ethics based on the ideas involving Virtues. <br />
<br />
A combination of presentation and group work will provide tools and techniques that can be used by individuals and teams to examine and develop their Ethical approach. What are the Virtues for a Technologist? How might we learn and develop these Virtues?<br />
<br />
<br />
