<h1>‘What would YOU Call This Workshop?’ And Other Powerful Questions</h1>
<p>​Bad questions lead to bad answers, like “42”. Break this cycle, learn to ask the right questions!</p>

<p><em>Exercise, Practice, Discussion</em></p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Do you know how to ask questions? We all do, right? All kids go through a “why” phase. Can you remember yours? Or your kid’s? If you were a kid right now, how exactly would you ask one more question, to an adult that had one too many already, in order to get a real answer? And did you realize we used 4 different types of questions in this first paragraph? Each had a different purpose...<br />
<br />
Whether in a mob, pair programming, or just in a team working with other human beings, good questions are paramount. Asking a misguided or inaccurate question can lead you down the wrong rabbit hole... or destroy the energy of your group altogether. In other words, if you can’t communicate clearly, you’re toast.<br />
<br />
So start thinking about the questions you ask. Experience the “Question Formulation Technique” exercise. Experiment with different question forms and become an interrogation expert. That's the plan of this workshop.</p>

<h2>Audience background</h2>
<p>A previous experience with pair- and mob-programming would be a bonus, but by no mean necessary.</p>

<h2>Benefits of participating</h2>
<p>Participants will experience the “Question Formulation Technique” through which they will recognize the effects of open and closed questions. They will also come to realize that going from one to the other requires training.<br />
<br />
They will then learn about different Question Types: rhetorical, leading, Probing and the occasional advantage of a Clean Language approach.<br />
<br />
They will finally get to use the acquired knowledge in pair/mob role play scenarios and discover how they can use those questions in their daily life.</p>

<h2>Materials provided</h2>
<p>Slides with definitions and examples.<br />
Guidelines for the exercises.</p>
