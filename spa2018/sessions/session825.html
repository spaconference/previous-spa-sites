<h1>Well what would you do next...?</h1>
<p>An adventure game of mistakes, dilemmas, jeopardy, triumphs and learning opportunities.</p>

<p><em>Workshop - 75 mins</em></p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>As humans and leaders we all make mistakes - most of them without heavy consequences. Every now an then though we really drop the ball.<br />
We generally survive even these mistakes, but do we take the learning opportunities that come from them?<br />
<br />
In this session we'll play an adventure game (like those old-skool books back in the day) - various scenarios (some based on real events) will be played back and the participants will be asked at a crucial juncture "What would YOU do next?", then given 2 or three options to choose from. The path chosen is played out, and we'll look at what the learning opportunities were and whether and how you could take them.<br />
<br />
There will be a chance for teams to create their own scenarios and play the game with others in the session - hopefully with a sense of fun!<br />
<br />
We'll also look at possible strategies for: <br />
- dealing with high pressure decisions<br />
- doing the right thing<br />
- dealing with the consequences of mistakes<br />
- gleaning the positive learning opportunities when mistakes are made</p>

<h2>Audience background</h2>
<p>Anyone taking on the lead role at any level and being asked to make decisions, and then own them.</p>

<h2>Benefits of participating</h2>
<p>- Enjoy re-telling stories and reflecting on how you survived those tight spots<br />
- Gain some new tools to deal with difficult decision point and when they don't go so well<br />
- Find ways of seeing the positive learning opportunities that come from mistakes you make </p>
