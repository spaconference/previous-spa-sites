<h1>Better Whiteboard Sketches</h1>
<p>How to draw better whiteboard sketches for software architectures</p>

<p><em>Practical workshop</em></p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Have you ever looked at a whiteboard sketch and thought “What are all these squiggles?!” This session is for you.<br />
<br />
This is an interactive workshop for people who want to communicate more clearly using whiteboard sketches for software architecture, systems architecture, data flow, etc.<br />
<br />
Using some simple principles (and a sprinkling of psychology) you will learn some practical techniques for making better whiteboard sketches. Your new sketches will be memorable for people and help to get across your points more clearly.<br />
</p>

<h2>Audience background</h2>
<p>Some experience of drawing diagrams of software architecture, systems architecture, or data flow, (etc.) would be useful but not essential.</p>

<h2>Benefits of participating</h2>
<p>Communicate better with colleagues and clients.<br />
<br />
Reduce ambiguity in diagrams without resorting to Visio or UML.<br />
</p>

<h2>Materials provided</h2>
<p>Hand-held whiteboards<br />
Dry-wipe markers<br />
Worksheets<br />
</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>Individual working using whiteboards or flipcharts and pens. Can be done in pairs.<br />
Attendees undertake a series of guided exercises.<br />
</p>

<h2>Detailed timetable</h2>
<p>TBC but something like this:<br />
00:00 - 00:05 - Introduction and overview<br />
00:05 - 00:15 - draw a familiar system<br />
00:15 - 00:30 - some psychology and background<br />
00:30-00:45 - basics of Better Whiteboard Sketches<br />
00:45 - 01:00 - revise earlier sketches<br />
01:00 - 01:15 - presentations, discussion, wrap-up<br />
</p>

<h2>Outputs</h2>
<p>Attendees will take away an understanding of some practical techniques to make better whiteboard sketches for software and systems architecture, along with a printed / PDF “cheat sheet” summarising the techniques.<br />
