<h1>Behind the AI Curtain - Designing for Trust in Machine Learning Products</h1>
<p>Whether you're launching a voice assistant or predictive recommendations, designing for trust matters more than ever for the user experience of products powered by machine learning and AI.</p>

<p><em>Case Study</em></p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>When startups first launch, they can make the news with application of cutting edge artificial intelligence (AI) - but convincing users to trust the AI is often another story. There's often also no process for integrating future AI development into product roadmaps. <br />
<br />
This session covers three key principles for how design and data science teams can work together better to build greater trust among users. Additionally, a case study on how a design and data science team partnered to redesign predictive analytics scores powered by machine learning will illustrate those principles in practice. Along the way, we'll learn a few key principles from the fields of data visualization, user research, and content strategy, and why they in particular are relevant to designing for machine learning products.</p>

<h2>Audience background</h2>
<p>How will they benefit? *	<br />
The audience members who would benefit most from this session are content strategists, product managers, UX designers, and developers who work with data scientists or want to be prepared to work on machine learning products soon. Ideally, attendees have some familiarity with how machine learning is used in popular consumer apps (e.g. Netflix recommendations).</p>

<h2>Benefits of participating</h2>
<p>1. Learn how to create an effective process for designers, developers, and data scientists to collaborate together<br />
2. Learn three key principles for building greater trust in machine learning<br />
3. Hear how those principles were put into practice with a case study</p>

<h2>Materials provided</h2>
<p>presentation<br />
case study materials</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>I'll start off with a brief presentation, then introduce a case study. Next, we'll divide attendees into small working groups to work through a few exercises specific to a case study. Finally, groups will present back to the team on what they learned in prototyping and testing a voice assistant.</p>

<h2>Detailed timetable</h2>
<p>00:00 - 00:20: presentation<br />
00:20 - 00:25: introduce a case study, divide attendees into small working groups<br />
00:25 - 00:60: teams work through a few exercises specific to a case study<br />
00:60 - 00:75: groups will present back to the team on what they learned</p>

<h2>Outputs</h2>
<p>I'll send followup content after the workshop on key lessons learned and resources for learning more:<br />
1. Less is often more when it comes to visualizing content<br />
2. When testing content, make sure to ask the right questions<br />
3. Writing well matters a lot, especially when it comes to conversational UI products (e.g. voice assistants). Tactically, you can design conversations with the same design tools, you just have to adapt your process.</p>
