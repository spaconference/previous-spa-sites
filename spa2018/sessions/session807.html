<h1>Writing slow regexp is easier than you think (and want it to be)</h1>
<p>Difference between fast and slow regular expressions can be so small many developers do not notice it. It is worth to focus on it, as a slow regex can stop entire application.</p>

<p><em>Talk with excercises (practice</em></p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although regular expressions are commonly used in software development, few developers think about their performance. The sad truth is that a badly written regexp can severely damage application performance (both on server-side and in a browser). How to write a regular expression that is not only correct but also efficient?<br />
<br />
To answer this question I will explain how regular expressions work. Basing on that I will show why two similar regexps may have exponential differences in performance. I will explain how to optimise regular expressions by giving examples related to text search, form validation and text parsing. I will also tell what I learnt while handling seemingly simple task of counting numbers in texts written in various languages. During the session participants will have possibility to try various techniques of regexp optimization.<br />
<br />
How to efficiently validate an input text? What traps to avoid during searching in big files? Why is it a good idea to write long regular expressions? And last but not least: is it possible that a simple and innocent looking regexp can stop an application? These are questions I want to answer in my talk.</p>

<h2>Audience background</h2>
<p>Basic knowledge of regular expressions and text processing. Programming skills in at least one language.</p>

<h2>Benefits of participating</h2>
<p>Understanding of theory behind regular expressions and popular methods of implementation. Common performance pitfails. and techniques of regexp optimization. Threats related to using regular expressions.<br />
