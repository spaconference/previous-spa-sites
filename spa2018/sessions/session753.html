<h1>EventStorming: a Hands-On</h1>
<p>EventStorming is about learning and sharing a common understanding of a business.</p>

<p><em>Practice ( preferably 150 min)</em></p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>How do we know that a development team understands something in the same way the business does?<br />
How can we see and model a system as it really is, with all its complexity and ambiguities?<br />
How do we know that we are working to solve the right problem ?<br />

<br />
EventStorming, especially the Big Picture format, is about discovering, learning and sharing <br />
this common understanding, complexity and problems.<br />
<br />
EventStorming takes its roots in Domain Driven Design.<br />
It is about learning the domain, as fast as possible, together with the business <br />
Breaking the silos that exists in some companies between business and IT.<br />
So that we, in IT , can describe the model in business terms instead of technical ones.<br />
<br />
Using only an unlimited supply of stickies, pens and long paper rolls on walls.<br />
<br />
We will use a real domain (HR in goverment), with all it's ambiguities and peculiarities.<br />
<br />
We will go from no knowledge about the domain to a Big Picture model, to more details on some of the key<br />
aspects.<br />
<br />
At the end of the session, you should be able to run, or at least dare to try out, EventStorming in your own<br />
daily work.</p>

<h2>Audience background</h2>
<p>Anybody involved in software : <br />
from users to decision makers, developers, product owners, architects, ...</p>

<h2>Benefits of participating</h2>
<p>Participants will be able to experiment with EventStorming in their own domain.<br />
<br />
I will gain new insights on my domain ;-)<br />
 </p>

<h2>Materials provided</h2>
<p>- Lots of Stickies<br />
- Pens<br />
- Roll of Papers <br />
<br />
- an available Flipchart / whiteboard would be handy<br />
- I will need walls to hang long paper rolls....</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>The group will be divided.<br />
<br />
* In the first first round each team will discover the Big Picture and discover the domain from a high level point of view <br />
<br />
* In the second round each team will be steered into a specific part of the domain.<br />
<br />
* In the last round , the team will be shuffled, with one or two member remaining, they will play the role of domain expert.<br />
The new members will experience Legacy.<br />
<br />
(This is to experience different learning and knowledge sharing aspect of a Big picture EventStorming session)<br />
<br />
There will be multiple rounds of EventStorming, during that time I will play the role of domain expert.<br />
<br />
Between the rounds<br />
<br />
* the team will be encouraged to make small retrospective so that groups will discover what kind of issues<br />
can arise during an eventstorming<br />
* some incremental theory & tips will be added.</p>

<h2>Detailed timetable</h2>
<p>00:00- 00:20 theory : About EventStorming , explanation of Domain at large  <br />
00:20- 00:40 Doing : First round eventstorming - Big Picture  <br />
00:40- 01:00 Discussion: what went well, what was difficult,  <br />
01:00- 01:20 Doing : Second round eventstorming - Big Picture   <br />
01:20- 01:40 Discussion: Big Picture, what for.<br />
01:40- 02:00 Doing : Third round eventstorming - Big Picture  + Team shuffling<br />
02:00- 02:20 Wrapup/questions : insights, where to go from here ?  <br />
<br />
10 minutes over to take into account the unexpected <br />
<br />
Each team, during the first 2 rounds will be steered into a specific part of the domain in order to allow the shuffle of the third round</p>
