<h1>Functional Programming Beyond Immutability</h1>
<p></p>

<p><em>75 min tutorial/exp report</em></p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>For many years we’ve been happily programming in a mixed OO / FP style. We structured code and data with objects and message passing, but implemented the methods on these objects in a declarative functional way, with variables, collections and objects as immutable as possible.<br />
<br />
Kotlin has proved a gateway drug to to a purer functional style. In this session we’ll see how functional programmers solve problems like error handling, configuration and managing mutable state. We’ll share what worked for us, and what proved to be going too far given the constraints of the language.</p>

<h2>Audience background</h2>
<p>Experienced developers with a background in OO</p>



<h2>Process</h2>
<p>An old fashioned presentation with plenty of code samples and opportunities for the audience to contribute their experience.</p>
