<h1>Negotiating For Your Life</h1>
<p> How to Master Critical Leadership Conversations</p>

<p><em>Workshop</em></p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Is your work day mired with conversations that go nowhere in spite of your best efforts to lead? Do you find meetings die a death without positive actions? Do you wish you could get more of your own way for the greater good?<br />
<br />
We believe that leadership begins with ourselves. And that most conversations involve some form of negotiation, from negotiating for organisational change to a pay rise and where to go for lunch.<br />
<br />
Join A.C.E. Negotiators (short for Agile, Chilled and Empathetic) Portia Tung, Tom Roden and Marco Milone, a diverse group of Agile coaches and leaders with more than 40 years of collective experience in Agile, for a chance to grow your negotiation skills and put them to the test in a safe, friendly and playful environment designed to help you be at your best.<br />
<br />
This fun and interactive workshop is based on the 9-step negotiation process developed by FBI Agent Chris Voss who has used it successfully from hostage negotiations to MBA classrooms and even at home.</p>
