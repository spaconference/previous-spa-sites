<h1>Typing is not the hard part - Developing a culture of pair programming</h1>
<p>Practice techniques to help you and your team develop a healthy pairing culture</p>

<p><em>Workshop</em></p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>There is a misconception both inside and outside our industry that programming is about typing code. This idea has lead to a false understanding of how to measure the productivity of software teams along with what constitutes ‘adding value’<br />
<br />
Pair (and Mob) programming place the focus of software development on the building of a shared mental model between team members rather than working alone. However we often expect people with no prior experience to take to these practices (and enjoy them) with little or no training. <br />
<br />
In this workshop participants will practice two different pair programming techniques that can be used both in day to day work or as the basis for learning exercises.</p>

<h2>Audience background</h2>
<p>Anyone with an interest in collaborating to write software<br />
Familiarity with Java, Ruby, or Python<br />
</p>

<h2>Benefits of participating</h2>
<p>See how to use intentional practice to develop pairing skills<br />
Learn techniques to improve the way you collaborate on building software<br />
See a variety of ways people approach the same problem<br />
Develop communication skills<br />
</p>

<h2>Materials provided</h2>
<p>A GitHub repository with skeleton code for each exercise (Participants can choose from Java, Python and Ruby)</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>Participants will work in pairs to complete two pairing exercises each designed to demonstrate different approaches to pairing and encouraging different behaviours</p>
