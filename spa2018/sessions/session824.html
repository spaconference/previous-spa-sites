<h1>The Right Research</h1>
<p>Being user-centred at every stage of your agile project</p>

<p><em>Practice workshop</em></p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>"UX" and "user centred" have been buzzwords in software and digital product design for nearly twenty years. In spite of this, there are still many software products for which users are the last group considered after the organisation, project sponsor, senior stakeholders, and the team.<br />
<br />
Content:<br />
Learn how user research and data analytics work with agile software development, understand the differences between quantitative and qualitative research and when to use them, and discover how to find the right people to be your research participants. Plan your own research approach for a project you are working on now.<br />
<br />
Objectives:<br />
Workshop participants will emerge with an understanding of how research can help guide and de-risk complicated projects, as well as have a sense of what types of research they can use in their own work.</p>

<h2>Audience background</h2>
<p>For software pros who have heard a lot about "UX" and "user centred" product design but aren't sure how to do it<br />
Relevant jobs: project managers, product owners, business analysts, developers, UI designers</p>

<h2>Benefits of participating</h2>
<p>Gaining benefits for your projects from more than just user testing or multivariate testing<br />
Avoid using the wrong research method and ending up with misleading "answers" to your product questions<br />
Stop guessing, copying your competitors, and blindly experimenting your way through your product roadmap</p>

<h2>Materials provided</h2>
<p>Templates, case studies, post-it notes, markers<br />
Takeaway research reference</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>Exercises<br />
Group sharing/presenting back</p>

Project phases: the typical phases of an agile software development process. <br />
00:25 - 00:35 Breakout groups: using your group case study, what questions about your users and their experience do you think you might have during each phase?<br />
00:35 - 00:40 The researcher's toolkit: how researchers get the right info to answer the right questions the right way<br />
00:40 - 00:50 Breakout groups: using your group's case study, draft a research approach that could give insights into your users and how your product needs to develop. <br />

<br />
00:55 - 00:60 Conclusions (group discussion)<br />
