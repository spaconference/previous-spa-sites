<h1>You Too Can Be A Sketching Machine!</h1>
<p>It's time to harness the power of sketching to ideate, iterate, and communicate.</p>

<p><em>Practice</em></p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sketching is an easily overlooked skill for developers yet the benefits that sketching brings cannot be overstated. Sketching helps with brainstorming ideas, iterating through concepts, and communicating your ideas to others. Whether working individually or in a group, your ability to sketch helps take the abstract ideas out of heads and into the real world. If you’re not comfortable sketching then there is little chance that your ideas will stick with you, your team members, and even your clients. Don’t worry—the confidence you need to put your pen to paper and start to sketch is close at hand! With the addition of a few simple approaches to your daily routine, you too can harness the power of sketching. <br />

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>My hands-on talk is structured to provide some background about sketching and how it helps to ideate, iterate, and collaborate. I then jump into the sketching exercises.<br />
<br />
Exercise 1: Warmup<br />
<br />
Exercise 2: Spontaneous Sketching<br />
- Introduction to the exercise<br />
- There are 6 prompts to sketch with less time for each prompt. The first prompt time is 2 minutes to sketch. For the last prompt the participants have just 5 seconds to sketch.<br />
- Share the sketches with the person next to them. This helps people meet new people in a fun way and make the conference more exciting. It also helps them see the power of sketching to collaborate and share ideas.<br />
<br />
Exercise 3: Rapid Sketching<br />
- Introduction to the exercise<br />
- There are 10 prompts to sketch. The participants have 10 seconds to sketch concepts like love, weather, sharing etc.<br />
- Share the sketches with the person next to them. This helps participants see the power of sketching to collaborate and share ideas.<br />
<br />
Exercise 4: 10 Circles<br />
- Introduction to the exercise<br />
- The worksheet for this exercise has 10 empty circles on it. The participants have 30 seconds to fill in each circle. A buzzer sounds after 30 seconds letting them know that it's time to move to the next circle. The goal of this exercise is to get the participants in the habit of getting their ideas out quickly and providing constraints of time and space. <br />
- Share the sketches with the person next to them. This helps participants see the power of sketching to collaborate and share ideas.<br />
