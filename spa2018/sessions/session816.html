<h1>Learn to run agile game sessions</h1>
<p>A fun and interactive way of teaching agile principles</p>

<p><em>game</em></p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The facilitator's guides for the games we showed you can be found here: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/agile-games">https://sites.google.com/view/agile-games</a><br />
<br />
Thanks for joining us! <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
While some may be lucky enough to work in completely agile organisations, where everyone understands the value of how we work, this isn’t a reality for most people. <br />
<br />
The best way to learn is to experience working in an agile environment. However, with new team members or reluctant stakeholders, sometimes you don’t have the luxury of time. Games can be an engaging and reliable way to create the conditions that demonstrate the power of following agile principles.<br />
<br />
In this interactive session we’ll demonstrate two (or more!) of our favourite agile games, including:<br />
<br />
- the coin game: teaches the value of short delivery windows over big bang delivery<br />
- the ball game: teaches the value of retrospective<br />
<br />
Then we’ll give you the chance to run them yourself! And answer questions about dealing with difficult stakeholders. <br />
<br />
By the end of the session, delegates should feel confident to lead these games <br />
</p>

<h2>Audience background</h2>

<h2>Process</h2>

The facilitator will then explain the learning outcomes from the game, share their experience of running it - with particular focus on when things have gone wrong and how they've dealt with it, and a Q&A. Volunteers will then run themselves, with the facilitator and other delegates providing feedback.</p>
