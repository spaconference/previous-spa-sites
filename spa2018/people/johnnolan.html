  <p>With over 30 years of experience at the forefront of technology, my career has been about changing the cutting edge into the bleeding edge: applying the big ideas and making them practical. From technologies such as objects, distributed computing and smart-dust through to process innovations like change management and agile software delivery, I've always taken a hands-on, "let's make it work" approach - delivering in diverse domains from finance, advertising, engineering, transportation, publishing, media  and telecoms.<br />
<br />
 I am long-time associate of SPA (and OT since the first conferences) and was Conference Chair in 2005</p>
