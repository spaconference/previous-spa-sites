  <p>Tim is a full time geek, agile developer, bullshit-hunter, international speaker and a lot more. During the day, he works as Chief Learning Officer and Agile Coach for the MATHEMA Software GmbH company in Germany. But when the night comes, and his small family is put to bed, he prefers to plot the transformation of the people around him into mythical beings, unicorns developers.</p>
