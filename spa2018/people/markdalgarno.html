  <p>I work for Software Acumen (<a href="http://www.software-acumen.com/">http://www.software-acumen.com/</a>) a consultancy and events company. I'm also involved in Joylab (<a href="http://joylab.co.uk">http://joylab.co.uk</a>) a boutique consultancy focussed on early-stage idea development and prototyping for digital services.<br />
<br />
I mainly do agile coaching and delivery management - up to Head of Software / CTO level. For the past 5 years I've been part of the UK Government's transformation to agile, user-centred delivery for services. I've consulted for the Government Digital Service and various government departments and am a Digital Service Standard Assessor for Agile Delivery and contributor to the UK Government Service Manual.<br />
<br />
I also organise a bunch of agile, user experience and service design conferences in the UK and run a few meet-up groups. Supported by my brilliant Software Acumen team.<br />
<br />
I've been involved in SPA in one way or another since 2005. For me it's the canonical practitioner conference.</p>
