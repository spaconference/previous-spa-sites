  <p>Tom is a born-again software developer: having left insurance to study computer science, he has since worked in pensions administration, then at LMAX Exchange, and now at Unruly, where he tries to balance his interest in functional programming with the fact that we're working in Java by building and evangelising as much of a functional approach as Java allows.</p>
