<p>
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic SPA2020 was cancelled, however SPA2021 will continue 
the tradition of the SPA conference series, but in virtual format, bringing together
experts and practitioners to share the latest thinking and experience in software development.
</p>
<p>
The website for SPA2021 can be found <a href="https://www.spaconference.org">here</a> 
and contains all of the information needed to submit session proposals and participate 
in the conference.
