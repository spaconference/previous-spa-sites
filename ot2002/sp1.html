  <p >
  
  In some projects quality and productivity are seen as variables to be traded
  off against each other. This is not a good strategy, nor is it reflected in
  the performance of the best teams, who not only deliver software faster -
  they deliver better software. To make software development faster you must
  ensure the process applied has fewer steps, especially fewer manual steps.
  To make better software, you must measure the quality and then ensure, build
  by build and release by release, the quality exceeds the currently achieved
  level until it always exceeds the required level. 
  
  <p> This paper suggests
  four principles for developing better software faster: 
  <ul> 
    <li>maintain a single model 
    <li>conform to a simple meta-model 
    <li>use a perturbation change model 
    <li>continuously measure quality. 
  </ul> 
  <p> 

  Using a single model (with multiple diagrammatic or textual views) is the
  key simplification that reduces the workload through the project, opening
  the way to many automated steps (e.g. pattern and refactoring automation,
  deployment experts, document generation, test automation, etc.). The simple
  meta-model links requirements, design implementation and tests. Conforming
  to it ensures: every requirement has a corresponding design; the design
  references only valid classes and operations; every requirement and every
  operation has a valid test set; and that all the tests pass. The
  perturbation change model emphasizes the small steps from valid build to
  valid build that is implied by an iterative lifecycle. It also shows why
  building high quality software also improves productivity since every step
  in the process builds on the work of the team thus far. Continuous
  measurement of quality involves many traditional tools (testing, metrics,
  automated audits, generated documents and inspections), but their
  application in an iterative lifecycle means they must be modified for
  continuous application.
  
  <p>
  As well as discussing these principles and how they may be applied with any
  modern development process (e.g. FDD, UP, XP, DSDM) and in any development
  environment which supports a "single-source" approach, the presentation will
  be illustrated with TogetherSoft's Together ControlCenter™
  model-build-deploy platform, (using Version 6.0, which is scheduled for
  release very shortly).
