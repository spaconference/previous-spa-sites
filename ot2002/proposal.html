One of the most rewarding ways to participate in OT is to lead a session. 
<!--The sessions – their subjects and formats – define the character of the conference.-->
This is your opportunity to ensure the conference deals with the issues that
affect and interest you. 
You don’t necessarily have to be an expert - a good session is one that provides a structured
forum for participants to develop their ideas, skills, and knowledge. A well-established shepherding process is in
place to provide assistance and support to presenters.

<P>Proposals for sessions are welcome on any aspect of contemporary
software practice. <a href="/scripts/wiki?HelenSharp">Helen Sharp</a>, this year's Programme Chair, 
will be glad to discuss your ideas.
<p>Take a look at <a href=http://www.ot2001.org/programme.html>last year's programme.</a>

<P><B>25 September</b> is the closing date for proposals.

<LI>Discuss your ideas with others, including <A

<P>If your proposal is accepted, you will be given help in working out

<TR VALIGN=TOP>

<TD VALIGN=TOP COLSPAN=5>The OT conference has a tradition of active

participation. We encourage conference sessions that bring people together

to work and learn &mdash; in most cases, sessions are highly interactive, involving

participants and session leaders on an equal footing. The types of session

that typically make up the programme are described here, although if you

are proposing a session and want to do something different, we always welcome

new suggestions.</B></TD>

<P>With the exception of working groups which run for 6 hours, a session can be either 
75 minutes or 150 minutes.  Please state the intended duration when submitting. 

<P>All session leaders are responsible for the process of the session, for any 
materials that may be needed, and for ensuring that the output from their sessions 
is captured for publication by the Organisers on the OT2002 website. Sessions may take 
many different forms and submitters are free to propose their own structure and process. 
However, it is very important that proposals are explicit about the process that will be followed.

<td align=right><h3>Workshop</h3>
<DIV ALIGN=right><P><I>75 or 150 minutes</I></DIV>


</TD>

<TD width="40%">



Workshops are sessions in which participants work in a structured

way on a topic set by the workshop organiser. At the end of the workshop,

the participants, in conjunction with the workshop organiser, would normally

produce and make available to other participants some conclusions and,

ideally, suggestions for avenues worthy of further investigation.</B></P>

</TD>


<td rowspan=3 class=bg>&nbsp;</td>

<td align=right><h3>Tutorial</h3>
<P><I>75 or 150 minutes</I>
</TD>


<TD width="40%">A tutorial consists of a presentation on a clearly focussed topic

which is aimed at a defined category of software professional. For example

a tutorial could be aimed at experienced project managers, or at professionals

actively working on object-oriented design projects. You should have a

clear idea of what insights your participants will take away, and why they

will find these interesting.

<P>While tutorials are expected to contain a certain amount of formal

lecturing, you should try to incorporate a degree of interaction between

participants, for example by including a quiz or questionnaire, or time to reflect 
and discuss how the tutorial content may be applied in the attendees' own circumstances. 
A summary of the tutorial topic together with a summary of any discussions would be 
suitable 'output' from a tutorial session.</P>

<h3>Goldfish Bowl</h3>
<P><I>75 or 150 minutes</I>

</TD>



<TD>A goldfish bowl provides an effective means of exploring the breadth

of opinion on a given topic. The session is started by a small discussion

group (say four or five people) consisting of specially invited participants,

with the rest of the participants forming an audience. Spare places in

the discussion group are available, and members of the audience may take

up these places when they feel they have a contribution to make. Members

of the discussion group leave their places when they have had their say,

making room for new participants.

<P>The session should produce documentary output of the conclusions

reached, typically in the form of a poster.</P>

<TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP>

<h3>Case Study</h3>
<P><I>75 or 150 minutes</I>

</TD>



<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>A case study session aims to describe real-life

experiences and lessons learnt. Discussion

of failures as well as successes is welcome. The experiences described

can be drawn from any aspect of contemporary software practice.


<P>Useful topics to address in a case study session would be:

rationale and consequences of technology choice for a particular project; 
experiences of designing and developing; effect of technology on development 
process; what went wrong and why; what went well

and why; what lessons have been learnt from the experience. 
A summary of the case study covering these issues would be suitable 'output' 
from a case study session.

<h3>Simulation</h3>
<P><I>75 or 150 minutes</I>

</TD>

<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP> 

Given the complexity of the real-world environment in which we
practice software, it is often not possible to reflect clearly on the
way we work or to experiment with new approaches. Using simulations
and games however allows us to think about these situations with
increased clarity. A simulation leader must provide a clear and concise 
summary of the purpose, rules and assumptions of the game, and guidance 
for reflecting on the results of the game and its implications for real-world 
practice.  The output from the sessions is likely to include both
summary results from the simulation and a summary of its real-world
implications.

<TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP>

<h3>Think Tank</h3>
<P><I>75 or 150 minutes</I>

</TD>



<TD>A think-tank session consists of a small group of people meeting

to solve a particular problem or to find an agreed position on some issue.

Think-tank sessions are intensive, focused and produce concrete output

in the form of a poster for other conference participants.

<TD VALIGN=TOP align=right>

<h3>Working Group</h3>
<P><I>6 hours elapsed</I>

</TD>



<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP colspan=4>A working group is formed to conduct a detailed

exploration of some aspect of contemporary software practice, to identify how that aspect

can be advanced, and then to put in motion the work needed

to achieve this advance. Working groups are run to encourage the exchange

of ideas between practitioners and researchers with the aim of generating

or encouraging progress that is applicable to the software community at

large. A leader of a working group may require some pre-conference input

from participants (submission of a position paper or preparation of a pattern

for review, for example).

<P>Formal working group sessions take place on the afternoon of Sunday

7 April 2002. Groups may continue to meet during

and after the conference.</P>
