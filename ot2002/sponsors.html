<p><font size="+1">OT is the foremost conference on contemporary
software practice. Now in its 10th year, this event regularly attracts between
150 and 250 participants, the vast majority of whom play a leading role
in product recommendation and acquisition: our audience comprises both
technical software specialists and IT management.</font>
</p>
<p>
In addition, the conference attracts prominent industry figures: for example, 
over the past three years, participants included Bruce Anderson, Kent Beck, 
Frank Buschmann, James Coplien, John Daniels, Ian Graham, and Steve Vinoski. 
This conference is firmly established as the event at which new ideas and fresh 
thinking on software practice emerge.

</p><p>OT2002 will explore a broad range of
subjects from leading-edge technology, through pioneering software development
and deployment practices, to innovative techniques for managing projects
and the people that make up the project team.
</p><p>Becoming a sponsor of OT2002 provides
the highest possible profile at the event. Sponsors receive the following
benefits:
</p><dir>
<h3>Before the conference</h3>

<img src=Image/plenary.jpg  align=right>
<p><b>Prominent billing</b> as a sponsor in all promotional activities and materials.
<p>
The OT2002 web pages play a major role in promoting and administering the
event. The web site carries full details of all aspects of the conference,
and is used heavily by potential conference participants for finding out
about the event, making session submissions, and making bookings.
</p>
  <p>In addition brochures are being
distributed to the following lists:
</p>
 
  <ul>
  <li> Highly qualified mailing lists of practising IT professionals.
  <li> OOPS Group members.
  <li> Members of other selected BCS Special Interest Groups.
  <li> Selected pertinent magazine readerships.
  </ul>

  <p><b>Billing in Press Releases.</b> All Press Releases issued for the conference
  will explicitly list the names of sponsors of the event.
  
  <P>The opportunity to <b>provide a corporate gift</b>.
  A gift in the delegate bag provides sponsors with a prime opportunity to advertise 
  their name both at and beyond the conference.
  
  
<!--  <p><b>A supply of conference brochures.</b> Considerable mutual benefit can accrue
  if sponsors send out copies of the brochure to clients. Sponsor mailing
  lists can be incorporated into the event's marketing plan. Full confidentiality
  is guaranteed to any sponsor sending labels to our mailing house.
  -->

  <h3>At the conference</h3>
  
<img src=Image/demo.jpg width=200 height=160 align=right>
  <p><b>Display stand and demonstration area.</b> Display stands and demonstration
  areas are provided in a large room that is also used for conference participants
  to take refreshments and lunch. Each display stand and demonstration
  area is equipped with a power supply. A shell scheme stand,
  lighting and furniture can be ordered at an additional cost.
  <p><b>Speaking slot in the conference programme.</b>
  Each sponsor has the option of providing a speaker to present a full (non
  sales/marketing) session in the conference programme. Well-known speakers
  tend to attract larger audiences, and so we encourage sponsors to provide
  headline presenters.
  <p><b>Five conference places.</b> These places may be used for the
  sponsors' own staff or for client personnel.
  The full attendance fee for
  non-sponsors is &pound;1754.50 per participant.
  <p><b>Logo on items given to all conference participants.</b> Such
  items include the cover of the conference documentation, workbook, and
  other free handouts to participants.
  <p><b>Space for a feature in the conference documentation.</b> This
  space can be used for any form of A4 material, including leaflets and copies
  of advertisements.
  <p><b>Large signs</b> in the main conference room and at other key locations in the
  venue. Each sign will contain <i>Sponsored by</i> followed
  by the sponsor's logo.
  
  <h3>After the conference</h3>
  <p><b>A list of the names</b> and addresses of all conference participants.
  This list is provided for each sponsor to use whenever and however they
  like.
