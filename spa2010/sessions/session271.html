	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">When discussing software development we’re often talking about new development, where we’re developing a new system.  In reality though most software architects and technical leads repeatedly have to deal with large existing code bases of which little is known for certain and where it is difficult to assess their quality quickly.<br />
<br />
In this session we are going to experiment with some of the tools available today in order to assess their usefulness for this situation and we’ll try to identify which are the most useful, their strengths and weaknesses and the key things that we’d like to see tool builders develop in the future.  The focus of the session will be open source analysis and comprehension tools for Java code, but attendees will be welcome to bring and demonstrate other tools and explain their usefulness too.<br />
</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Audience background:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Anyone involved in the activity of software design. Ideally participants will have a working knowledge of Java development and commonly used development tools but this isn’t essential as people can pair in order to allow knowledge to be shared.</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Benefits of participating:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">* Exposure to a range of software analysis tools in a short period<br />
* Applying the tools to a standard problem to allow comparison<br />
* The insight gained from shared discussion on the strengths, weaknesses and relationships between the tools<br />

* Template form for tool comparison, including a list of specific features to look for and questions to ask about each tool (e.g. “what can be visualised”, “can a hierarchical view of data be achieved” and so on).<br />
* An open-source source code tree to use as an analysis problem with the tools<br />
* Four software analysis tools on the conference CD ROM in a form that allows rapid installation and use on the participant’s laptops.  The provisional list of tools is jDepends, Sonar, CodeCity and Structure 101.<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">* Presentation 1: Introduce the session, its objectives and the current state of practice in automated support for analysing and visualising large source code trees.<br />
<br />
* Session Setup: People break into small groups, pair if they would like to (or people don’t have laptops with them), get their laptops powered up and working.<br />
<br />
* Presentation 2: Short presentation explaining the code base we’ll be analysing and some things to look out for when analysing it; providing an overview of the tools that we’ve provided; and explaining the process for the rest of the session.<br />
<br />
* Exercises: the structure of the exercise is to (i) select a tool and install it; (ii) use it to investigate the source code base; (iii) fill in the evaluation and comparison form.  This is a time boxed exercise and the idea is that people will perform this process for a number of tools, as the session length allows (2 or 4 being the targets according to session length).  In the main we expect people to use the tools we provide, but if people have or are aware of other relevant tools, we’re happy if they introduce those to the session too.<br />
<br />
* Collecting Results: we poll the group and summarise people’s findings for each tool.  We will have asked them to make some simple assessments of the tool, namely: <br />
   - What is the main thing the tool does?<br />
   - What are its strengths, what are its weaknesses?<br />
   - How useful is it on a scale of 1-10?<br />
   - What is the one thing that would improve it?<br />
We’ll summarise these via group discussion, capturing results on the whiteboard, and then extend the discussion to identify any relationships between the tools.<br />
<br />
* Future Requirements: having had this experience, while people are thinking about the tool support they’d find useful, we’ll ask everyone to briefly describe one focused tool feature that they’d like to see developed in the future and capture this as a session output.<br />

[Note to reviewers: this could be presented as a 150 minute workshop or the 330 minute Sunday session. For a longer session, the section from 00:30 – 02:15 would be run twice and the discussion might take longer, so you’d end up with a 5 hour session approximately, fitting a Sunday slot.]<br />
