	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">There is currently a lot of talk about Lean, Kanban and related practices but what does it really mean to be a Lean business and, more importantly, what are the practical benefits to your business?  What do you need to put in place before you can operate on a Lean basis and how might that change the way you plan development of your products?  If you're interested in answering these questions then this session is for you.  We will demonstrate how technical innovation altered the way the business operates at uSwitch.<br />
<br />
You can see how we reduced time to market of an idea from 6 to 8 weeks to a matter of days.  You will hear how we dramatically increased the frequency of releases and how this forced us to make them more efficient.  Instead of releasing every 3 weeks and the process taking 2 or 3 days, we released two or three times a week with each taking a couple of hours.  Planning just-in-time and releasing on demand enabled us to launch a brand new site in an international market, from scratch, in under three weeks.  You will see the technology and processes we put in place to make this possible and how that changed our business.  You can gain an understanding of how these techniques can alter the attitude to risk, making it easier to quickly identify what works and what doesn’t.<br />
<br />
You will also hear about techniques for measuring the value of what you’re developing.  You will see how our business teams estimated value and also how we retrospectively measured value using multi-variate testing.<br />
