	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">This game is designed to teach, learn and experiment with how to use a Kanban System for Software Engineering. This is an approach which focusses on:<br />
* using visual management techniques to make the work transparent so that teams can collaborate and continuously improve their process<br />
* encouraging limiting work in progress in order to increase the flow of value so that the time between request to delivery is short as possible<br />
<br />
Attendees will form teams to work on a project, with the goal of delivering as much value as possible. Kanban principles and practices will be introduced and used to  allow the teams to experience how a Kanban System can help with managing the flow of work and dealing with variability and randomness.<br />
</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Audience background:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Anyone interested in learning how a Kanban System for Software Engineering can work. A Kanban based approach is one which can be implemented in an evolutionary manner, so no previous Agile experience is necessary. Those with some Agile experience will appreciate how Kanban is compatible with, rather than an alternative, to existing approaches.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Benefits of participating:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">How to use a Kanban Board effectively. A Kanban Board is the means to make the work transparent.<br />
How to achieve a smooth flow of work by limiting work in progress (WIP). This ensures that value moves through the system quickly rather than being held in queues or batches,<br />
How to use WIP limits to encourage teamwork and collaboration. Having less work in progress creates an environment where team members must work together.<br />
How to demonstrate capability and reliability with a pull system. Using a Kanban System to signal, rather than schedule work, requires a different approach to creating long term plans and forecasts.<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">After introductions, attendees will form small teams and be given materials to deliver a project. There will be 3 rounds to work on the tasks. Each round will introduce new "rules" which will add more principles of a Kanban System. Thus over the period of the game, the teams should experience how the different aspects of a Kanban System influence their process and ability. The session will finish with review to draw together the key learnings.<br />
<br />
I'd like to keep this to 75 mins to ensure it is focussed. Happy to 150 mins if more appropriate</td></tr>

Feedback, and lessons learned about the game, will be passed back to the games originators.</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>History:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">The session will be based on the Kanban Game run at Agile 2009, with modifications based on my feedback after having played it there (with permission) http://www.agile2009.org/node/970<br />
<br />
One of the main changes will be to compress is down, so if accepted, I will aim to arrange some trial runs to ensure the changes work (e.g. at Skills Matter)<br />
