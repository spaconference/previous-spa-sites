	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Although continuous integration and pair programming can be very effective, the concepts remain constrained by traditional development tools, the physical world, and our imaginations. Using a dynamic language, it is possible to push XP practices even further and create an environment where we are no longer limited by the number of people who can fit comfortably around a single workstation. An entire team of programmers can collaborate simultaneously on the same live code base; they never need to integrate because they always are.<br />
<br />
We have run a series of workshops using such an environment and have a range of interesting findings about pair programming, team collaboration in a single code space, continuous integration, and continuous testing. Can real-time collaboration shorten the time between idea conception and feature availability? What are the effects on product quality and team productivity? What technical and process challenges need to be overcome?<br />
<br />
We have also begun to consider how this kind of real-time collaboration can be used by distributed teams. Getting true collaboration, similar to putting everyone in the same room, is a significant challenge and today's tools are surprisingly limited. In this presentation, we share our observations, questions and current thinking.</td></tr>

They will be encouraged to consider how these concepts can be applied to distributed development teams.</td></tr>

Some fairly successful ones were for instance at SPA 2010 (as a BoF session), XTC, XP Days Benelux and Germany. An earlier experience report was presented at the European Smalltalk User Group conference in September 2010.</td></tr>
