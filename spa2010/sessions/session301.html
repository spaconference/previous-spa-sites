We have learned quite a few new ideas using different languages in the past 10 years or so. But then again we might be just fortunate. A lot of developers might be stuck in one language for years and years. So if you are stuck, this is your 2 hours intensive workshop out to get you out of your comfort zone. If you are lucky to work in different languages, this is your 2 hours of fun, playing around. For both of you, this is your 2 hour hands on learning and exchanging ideas experience.<br />
<br />
In this workshop we explore how you typically solve problems in different languages and how it can inspire you to do things differently in your current working environment. We will do this in a real SPA/XP Day workshop fashion: we invite experts in programming to learn from each others habits, language tricks and skills, without getting into language X vs language Y wars. The objective is to inspire and be inspired by other people's ways of doing stuff.<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">We bring some prepared program samples in a mainstream language (Java and C#) that have been literally translated into Python and Ruby and others. We ask participants to clean these up using the idioms from the language in question. Although we will have examples prepared in a few specific languages, we allow and encourage people to use a language of their choice. (if you plan to attend and would like the workshop to be prepared in another language, please let us know). We will mix and mingle people to get a lot of eyes on several results and change them along the way.<br />
<br />
The first part's aim is for people to inspire an get inspired by different ways of solving problems in a programming language.<br />
<br />
In the second part of the workshop we will brainstorm learning moments from the first part of the workshop; Learning moments on language constructs or on different ways to look at problem solving though use of another language. Then, in groups we create advertisements or campaigns for promoting these new ideas (or maybe campaigns to discourage them). </td></tr>
