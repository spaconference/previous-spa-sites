	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">You’re a mischievous wooden little boy who dreams of becoming a real manager. Now that your dream has come true, you find yourself stuck inside a whale’s stomach, stewing in a jacuzzi of digestive juices. The satanic little voice in your head says everything will be ok, but your protruding nose knows otherwise.<br />
<br />
In this session, you'll embark on an journey where you'll encounter two types of characters: the Baddies, such as Gideon and Foulfellow, who will try to lead you astray with temptations, and the Goodies, such as Gepetto, the Blue Fairy and Jiminy Cricket, who will help you find your way back to your goal.<br />
<br />
We'll bring along scenarios based on real-life project situations and share with you some Lean Leadership tools to help you get things back on track and stay on track. You'll get the chance to put the tools into practice and come up with 3 actions to take away to try out back at work.<br />
<br />
The Lean Leadership Tools are:<br />
     * Visual Controls - Use simple visual indicators to support Flow and Pull<br />
     * Leader Standard Work - Adhere to work processes as a discipline<br />
     * Daily Accountability - Use Visual Controls to improve process focus and drive Continuous Improvement <br />
     * Leadership Discipline - Set clear expectations and maintain process focus on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
Including those of a Learning Organisation:<br />
     * Nemawashi (Decisions based on Consensus) - Make decisions slowly by consensus then implement decisions quickly<br />
     * Hansei (Relentless Reflection) and Kaizen (Continuous Improvement) - Do regular analysis to establish a stable process and make incremental improvements.<br />
 <br />
All of which are guided by:<br />
     * Long-term Philosophy - Grow and align the whole organisation toward a common purpose that is greater than a purely financial reward.<br />
<br />
Join us to acquire these Lean Leadership tools and give your story a Happy Ending with the help of talking animals.<br />
<br />
'Pinocchio: On Becoming a Lean Leader' is the first in the Lean Fairytales series of learning games. If you liked Agile Fairytales, you'll love Lean Fairytales!</td></tr>
