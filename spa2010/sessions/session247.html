<br />
The first task for the performance engineer is to elicit and understand performance requirements. Everyone likes systems that are 'fast', but 'fast' won't do as a metric. We discuss the many facets of 'fast, but throughput is the main focus of the tutorial. Most projects are eager to maximize throughput because of its direct effect on system economics, increasing revenue and/or cutting costs. Moreover, although response times inevitably increase when load increases, techniques that maximize throughput in online applications also minimize response time rates of increase.<br />
<br />
In order to improve throughput, the current bottleneck resource must be found and used more efficiently. This procedure is followed iteratively until it becomes uneconomic to do so. Bottlenecks are identified by monitoring resource utilization. These techniques are to non-functional requirements what unit tests are to functional requirements.<br />
<br />
We discuss techniques for improving resource utilization and include examples of DBMS and application logic optimizations with their specific tooling for finding hot-spots.<br />
<br />
The final part of the session is an open discussion on the role of performance engineering in the development process.</td></tr>

Although metrics are treated rigorously, they are introduced by appealing to the intuition of the participants - they are encouraged and guided to derive the mathematical relationships that govern the performance metrics of a system. When they have gone through this process, most people find that they see previously-known concepts, such as 'bottlenecks', in a new light.</td></tr>
