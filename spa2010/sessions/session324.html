It's a training place, in which participants may learn, session after session, how to master "coding gestures", how to discuss design choices, and how to manage the stress that emerges from the necessity to express swiftly and efficiently a personal response to a given exercise. Emmanuel started the Coding Dojo in Paris with others 4+ years ago, and he has attended and shaped it ever since.<br />
<br />
This session will start as an experience report on how he and they have managed to create such a co-learning environment and make it thrive, it will pursue as a focused discussion in which participants will have the opportunity to discuss their own experience with dojos. </td></tr>

Attendees are expected to have some prior understanding that coders need to train themselves and learn their craft not only at school, but also throughout their whole career. </td></tr>
