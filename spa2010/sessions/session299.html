<br />
We will start with a specific use case, break into pairs and develop a simple language (or set of languages) for implementing some (but probably not all) of the functionality. We'll then compare approaches, discussing the trade offs and why we made them.<br />
<br />
The objective is to get the experience of specifically thinking about the design of a language without worrying about the details of implementation (internal vs. external, XML vs free text concrete syntax, etc).<br />

<br />
With a couple of SPA's under my belt, I'd love to be able to revisit this topic, with a very carefully designed set of requirements so we can focus on some of the common issues that arise (what should go in the language vs. what should be custom code, should we have one language or many, do we take concepts from the business domain, the technology domain or both, etc).  </td></tr>
