	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Although we all know: “copy and paste” is bad… sometimes as software developers we end up in situations where we need to write boring, unimaginative code that is repetitive – and so use some variation of copy and paste. Take typical getters and setters for example… the simple ones can be generated by the common IDE… but if they get a little more complex, one often has to revert to copy and paste of some sort. <br />
<br />
This session is about taking the first steps with a tool that can be added to a toolbox to help in such situations – as well as being one of the standard code generation tools. <br />
<br />
In this session you’ll learn the basics of building Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) with oAW.<br />
<br />
DSLs are special-purpose languages that can be used to create models of domain-specific concepts at a higher-level of abstraction than general-purpose programming languages can. The idea behind this is that specially written code generators can be used to process these models into lower-level languages saving you time and effort in developing finished software.<br />
<br />
We’ll start with a simple example and refine it during the session as new requirements and possibilities “emerge”.<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Audience background:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Some programming experience is essential. Prior experience using Eclipse would be useful, although it would be possible to pair with someone with this experience.<br />
<br />
It’s not necessary to have any experience of domain-specific languages – in fact the session is aimed at people with no prior experience in domain-specific languages – and so might be too basic for mdsd-experts ;-)..<br />
The goal of the session is to introduce the tool and how to use it so – while obviously we will be explaining the necessary concepts –  the primary focus of the session is on actually using oAW as a tool – and not on theoretically creating models and introducing the deeper theory of domain driven design or on discussing possibilities of integrating Code-Generation into the project life-cycle or on how to set up code generation projects.<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Benefits of participating:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">This session will let participants add another tool to their toolkit to become more effective in software development. <br />
<br />
Even though the primary focus will not be on the theory of code generation, the session will also give an introduction into this area<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">The session will be supported through slide-based exposition covering the key concepts.<br />
<br />
The bulk of the session will be a set of hands-on programming exercises starting from very simple exercises to build familiarity progressing to a longer exercise on building and evolving a small DSL.<br />
<br />
Participants are encouraged to pair program but this isn’t essential if you want to work on your own.<br />
<br />
We will run a short retrospective at the end of the session to give people a reserved time slot to share their experiences.<br />
