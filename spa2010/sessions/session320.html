This case study looks at how Oracle’s next generation of applications – Fusion – was conceived, developed and released. It discusses the issues involved when 3000 developers from different products, development backgrounds and skill sets were integrated and trained in the new technology and tooling stack that was developed for the job. How prototyping and training were used to kickstart the project and how insights gained in that process were fed back into the concurrent development of the technology and tooling. It will reveal in detail how many tables, screens, page flows, services, libraries and processes were developed and how they were managed – including design, versioning, build, testing, integration and release.<br />
