				Wow - it really has been a while since I've updated this blog. The problem is that I have a bunch of old content here that I don't want to kill, but I also want to pull together application generation and groovy content from two other blogs I have, centralize with a single blog and also create a new site to make it easy to keep up with my tweets, conference presentations and various publications by category.

Oh, and of course I'm locked with paying client work. Well, I *will* get this fixed up by the end of March. In the meantime, apologies for the lack of meaningful web presence!

        <i><p>This session was a demo of several CI servers.</p>

<p>CruiseControl, build-o-matic, Hudson, JetBrains TeamCity, Rational BuildForge, Zutubi Pulse2, Cruise.</p>

<p>I presented first - <a href="http://build-o-matic.sourceforge.net/">build-o-matic</a>. I think my talk was a bit rubbish because I didn’t get across the <span class="caps">USP </span>of build-o-matic. What is the basics of a CI server? I think one of the basics is to tell you which commit broke the build. </p>

<h3>What's the <span class="caps">USP </span>of build-o-matic?</h3>

<p>If there are multiple commits between builds, then build-o-matic is the only CI server that finds out which commit broke the build (<a href="http://ivan.truemesh.com/archives/000730.html">farm</a> and <a href="http://ivan.truemesh.com/archives/000694.html">binary search</a>). None of the others do, or even have the infrastructure to do it (apart from the <span class="caps">EAP </span>version of TeamCity sounds like it now has the infrastructure). Note that Pulse and TeamCity have a valid alternative approach to the problem with “personal builds” - which (I have used the TeamCity version of this feature) is quite cool.</p>

<h3>Why re-invent the wheel?</h3>

<p>I was asked after the talk why I had bothered to write my own CI server. Well, when I wrote the first version of build-o-matic, most of the other CI servers either didn't exist (eg Hudson) or were so new I hadn't heard of them (eg TeamCity). The ones that did exist didn't do what I wanted.</p>

<h3>Why not plugin to the trendy new CI servers?</h3>

<p>I was also asked why I didn't write a plugin for Hudson or TeamCity to achieve the same goals as build-o-matic. I don’t believe it would be possible to write a plugin for Hudson or the current version of TeamCity to do it, because they have no concept of running the build on a previous revision of the code (although the next version of TeamCity, the <span class="caps">EAP </span>version, will - so it may be possible with that). </p>

<h3>What did I think of the competitors?</h3>

<p>I have used TeamCity and think it's very good. Cruise looked very interesting. I heard good things about Pulse from people who had tried it. I can't see what the fuss is about Hudson (maybe I'm just not trendy enough). The others looked very complicated.</p>

<h3>The future of build-o-matic</h3>

<p>I'm not sure whether it has a future. The other CI servers have teams of people working on them full time (even though they still can't tell you which commit broke the build) and have lots of enterprise friendly features. I might keep working on build-o-matic - but many of the features that I'd like it to have are already in TeamCity. Talking to Yegor Yarko of JetBrains - the makers of TeamCity - it sounds very much like TeamCity is going to catch up with build-o-matic on it's currently unique features in the next version, which makes me wonder whether it's worth continuing with build-o-matic.</p>

<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>Jason Sankey wanted to add a comment - but unfortunately comments are switched off - so he sent me an email, which I've included here:</p>

<p>It was cool to see the binary search for the breaking build revision in build-o-matic.  This is a feature that has been on our wish list for Pulse for a while, and in particular our customers with long builds would like it.  I've yet to see anyone else who has actually done this.</p>

<p>Since the earliest versions of Pulse we have included a feature called "changelist isolation", which will trigger builds for each individual revision -- so if you have the resources to run a build on every revision you will be able to easily see when the build was broken. Obviously we don't advertise this feature enough!</p>

<p>It is also possible to trigger builds at a specified revision using the Pulse web UI or remote (XML-RPC) <span class="caps">API, </span>so in theory you could script the binary search externally and drive Pulse to build the desired revisions.</p></i>

        <i><p>On Friday I came across a nasty bug in <a href="http://selenium.openqa.org/">selenium</a> (but I still like it).</p>

<h3>Selenium wouldn't start</h3>

<p>The build was failing - and the reason was the last thing I expected (of course). The usually reliable selenium server just wouldn't start. Looking at the stack trace, then searching for likely looking parts of it (btw, for the search I tried, google, yahoo and altavista find the answer, but msn, cuil and askjeeves don't. Just thought I'd try them out because of the launch of cuil).</p>

<p>I found the <a href="http://clearspace.openqa.org/message/46309">answer</a> (I think you can turn the popup blocker back on again too - I think the problem is because the registry entry is missing rather than because of its value).</p>

<p>The stack trace is like this (in case you are searching too):</p>

<h3>Now that wasn't so difficult was it?</h3>

<p>The problem was caused by something I didn't do (but rather by some remote machine update thingie) which made it difficult, and the error message didn't give much of a clue (although looking at it carefully it does look like the registry value for the EvilPopupMgr can't be deleted because it doesn't currently exist).</p>

<h3>Having fixed the problem the CI build still won't work</h3>

<p>Having thought I'd fixed the problem - I fix up the CI build farm but the build still fails. Running the build manually on the CI farm machines is fine - running through the CI server isn't. The problem is that the CI server doesn't run the build as me - doh - so the "HKEY_CURRENT_USER" I've just fixed isn't the right one!</p>

<h3>Time for a cup of tea</h3>

<p>From the searches I've done it looks like I'm not the only person who has come across this problem - I hope by writing it up it'll save someone a bit of time. What would save even more time would be if the bug gets fixed - there is a suitable looking <a href="http://jira.openqa.org/browse/SRC-475">issue open</a> for this.</p></i>

Basically the modeling language, or actually its specification as a metamodel, sets the variation space. Compared to the traditional parameter tables and feature models the language-based approach can handle larger variation space and enable the creation of new features. </p><p>The most typical question is then how much effort goes to implementing the languages and generators and what are the benefits. Is the investment worthwhile? While I've written about the potential business value and economics of DSM for the DSM book (<a href="http://www.dsmbook.com/toc.html">Chapter 2</a>) we&rsquo;ll take another view to this topic at the coming <a href="http://www.codegeneration.net/cg2011/index.php">Code Generation Conference</a>. Together with Olli-Pekka Puolitaival from VTT we describe industrial experiences on applying domain-specific modeling languages and code generators in four different domains. They cover home automation, military radio, touchscreen controller and sports computer product lines. For each case we describe how the domain-specific languages were developed and applied. In particular we describe the experiences in terms of productivity or quality as well as analyze the gains against the investment made to define the DSLs. We also try to look the product line from a wider perspective so that we cover also other than software developers - testing and some of the requirements engineering phases can be supported by DSLs too.

<p>It is still a common belief that it takes a lot of time and effort to define modeling languages and code generators along with supporting tooling. For example, I&rsquo;ve recently worked with a customer who had already defined two languages but the tool support provided just tree view editors. For the real use they wanted to have proper modeling editors (with functions like hierarchical diagrams, tackling larger models, copy&amp;paste, undo&amp;redo etc), but the investment to define tooling was expected to be heavy and moreover postpone the use of their DSLs. </p><p>Well, it took one day to implement together with their expert these two languages into MetaEdit+ - and the languages were not toy languages having well over 100 constructs (in terms of <a href="http://www.metacase.com/mwb/define_concepts.html">MetaEdit+'s objects, roles, relationship etc</a>). At the second day we then started to use the languages to find out how they could be further improved and extended. </p><p>It is thus sometimes shocking - even for language engineers like in the company above - to see that the first version of their modeling language can be used the same day we started its creation. This month at OOP conference we try to give the same experience in our tutorial session in which participants can define hands-on a domain-specific modeling language and get proper tool support for it. Actually, we plan to create several versions of the language each time improving it (raise the level of abstraction, encapsulate domain rules to the language, minimize the need for modeling work, having model checking etc). </p><p><a href="http://www.sigs-datacom.de/oop2011/oop2011.html">OOP</a>, my favorite conference in Germany, takes place in M&uuml;nich 24-28th January and we are running with my colleage Risto Pohjonen <a href="http://www.sigs-datacom.de/oop2011/konferenz/sessiondetails.html?tx_mwconferences_pi1%5BshowUid%5D=292&amp;tx_mwconferences_pi1%5Bpointer%5D=0&amp;tx_mwconferences_pi1%5Bmode%5D=1&amp;tx_mwconferences_pi1%5Bs%5D=0">a full day tutorial</a> at 24th.

<p>It has been 10 years since OOPSLA&rsquo;01 hosted the <a href="http://www.dsmforum.org/events/DSVL01/DSVL01.html">first workshop of this series</a>, then called Domain-Specific Visual Languages. In those years domain-specific techniques and applications have matured significantly, as can be detected from the papers, presentations and group work results. In early workshops, individual domain-specific languages were presented and techniques were discussed. Throughout the years, workshop articles have looked at managing the complexity of created models, showing the impact on building industrial systems of significant size, and measuring the benefits of domain-specific techniques &mdash; to provide evidence that was quantitative, rather than anecdotal. The popularity of the workshop has been validated by the expansion of the workshop into a 2-day event in recent years, permitting time to hear the results of others, as well as actually spend time thinking and discussing new topics for research. </p><p>The visibility of the work reported has also grown over the years. While I&rsquo;ve been particularly satisfied that half of the PC and many of the papers come from the industry, the results have been also relevant for publications. Revised and expanded versions of workshop papers have appeared in journals such as IEEE Software, IEEE Computer, Journal of Software and Systems Modeling, Journal of Visual Languages and Computing, and Communications of the ACM. Now we are <a href="http://www.dsmforum.org/events/SoSymDSM11/ ">looking for submissions</a> to the special issue in the Journal of Software and Systems modeling. Also numerous conferences such as Software Language Engineering have sprung up around the idea of engineering languages. </p><p>Given the maturity of the organization, and growth of other venues, why is this workshop still held and attended? While other venues provide a place to discuss completed work, it is still important to have a place where still brewing ideas can be presented, and new collaborations can be forged through informal discussions and brainstorming. This is planned to happen again this year at the 10th DSM workshop. As the <a href="http://www.dsmforum.org/events/DSM10/index.html">program</a> shows there will be slots for <strong>working</strong> in the workshop. </p><p>In addition, there are presentations on topics covering DSM cases, transformation and testing, language design as well as tools and metamodeling. This year we received 27 submission and 18 were included into the proceedings available as printed and <a href="http://www.dsmforum.org/events/DSM10/papers.html">online</a> version. </p>

But the funny thing is, they are following the kind of hyper-local model that people like Jeff Jarvis have been preaching for a long while now:</p>
<blockquote>TriCityNews employs 3.5 people (the half-time employee handles circulation), has a print run of 10,000, and has a top line that can be written in six figures. Still, by setting rates low almost 10 years ago and never raising them or offering a Web option, Mr. Jacobson has built a reliable cadre of advertisers who call for ads, sign up for full pages, and pay in advance. There are no people working for sales commissions.</blockquote><blockquote>Editorially, the newspaper is boosterish -- &quot;we want people to think of Asbury Park as the center of the universe,&quot; he said</blockquote><p>I think that model works online as well, but note the main points - keep costs down, build up a trust relationship with your sponsors (advertisers), limit the waste (sales staff). In other words, deliver a great product, be true to your niche, and don't go overboard.</p>

<blockquote>At the time (mid-late October 2007) I found myself stymied by a lack of configurability in Vista's File Backup utility. Specifically, there was no way to directly specify which files or folders to backup - only highly generalized categories like &quot;Documents&quot; or &quot;Music.&quot; Worse still, Vista File Backup made a habit of skipping files it considered to be part of the operating system, including the myriad .aspx files I had created as part of my web development projects.</blockquote><p>I wonder if this can really be blamed on MS though. Say they had added decent backup software to Windows XP, or Vista - when they've pulled in other things to the OS, various parties (including the DOJ) have cried foul, and either brought or threatened anti-trust actions. I wonder how many things MS hasn't integrated simply due to fear of government intervention? </p><p>I also wonder how the various people who back such things think it's helped. I think most Mac owners now do backups because of how easy Time Machine makes it. Have we really been helped if useful software is kept at arms reach? Sure, you can buy a USB drive and use the software that comes with it, and sure - you can call the people who don't irresponsible. Being one of those people who just couldn't be bothered before Time Machine simplified my life though, I wonder.</p><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags:

MapReduce is a programming model for processing vast amounts of data. One of the reasons that it works so well is because it exploits a sweet spot of modern disk drive technology trends. In essence MapReduce works by repeatedly sorting and merging data that is streamed to and from disk at the <span style="font-style: italic;">transfer rate</span> of the disk. Contrast this to accessing data from a relational database that operates at the <span style="font-style: italic;">seek rate</span> of the disk (seeking is the process of moving the disk's head to a particular place on the disk to read or write data).
</p>

<p>
So why is this interesting? Well, look at the trends in seek time and transfer rate. Seek time has grown at about 5% a year, whereas transfer rate at about 20% <a href="#1">[1]</a>. Seek time is growing more slowly than transfer rate - <span style="font-style: italic;">so it pays to use a model that operates at the transfer rate</span>. Which is what MapReduce does. I first saw this observation in Doug Cutting's talk, with Eric Baldeschwieler, at <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2007/">OSCON</a> last year, where he worked through the numbers for updating a 1 terabyte database using the two paradigms B-Tree (seek-limited) and Sort/Merge (transfer-limited). (See the <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop-data/attachments/HadoopPresentations/attachments/oscon-part-1.pdf">slides</a> and <a href="http://us.dl1.yimg.com/download.yahoo.com/dl/ydn/hadoop.m4v">video</a> for more detail.)
</p>

<p>
The general point was well summed up by Jim Gray in an <a href="http://www.acmqueue.org/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=43">interview</a> in ACM Queue from 2003:
<blockquote>... programmers have to start thinking of the disk as a sequential device rather than a random access device.</blockquote>Or the more pithy: "Disks have become tapes." (Quoted by <a href="http://www.databasecolumn.com/2007/09/disk-trends.html">David DeWitt</a>.)
</p>

<p>
But even the growth of transfer rate is dwarfed by another measure of disk drives - capacity, which is growing at about 50% a year. David DeWitt <a href="http://www.databasecolumn.com/2007/09/disk-trends.html">argues</a> that since the effective transfer rate of drives is falling we need database systems that work with this trend - such as column-store databases and wider use of compression (since this effectively increases the transfer rate of a disk). Of existing databases he says:
<blockquote>Already we see transaction processing systems running on farms of mostly empty disk drives to obtain enough seeks/second to satisfy their transaction processing rates.</blockquote>But this applies to transfer rate too (or if it doesn't yet, it will). Replace "seeks" with "transfers" and "transaction processing" with "MapReduce" and I think over time we'll start seeing Hadoop installations that choose to use large numbers of smaller capacity disks to maximize their processing rates.
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-size:85%;"><a name="1">[1]</a> See <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/dahlin/techTrends/trends.disk.ps">Trends in Disk Technology</a> by Michael D. Dahlin for changes between 1987-1994. For the period since then these figures still hold - as it's relatively easy to check using manufacturer's data sheets, although with seek time it's harder to tell since the definitions seem to change from year to year and from manufacturer to manufacturer. Still, 5% is generous.</span>

          <a href="#" onclick="expandRSS('239151 at http://www.java.net'); return false;">Consistent Hashing</a>
        </strong>
        - <em>27-Nov</em>

      <div class="spalayouthideabletext" id="239151 at http://www.java.net">
        <i><!-- 2980 | 0 --><img src="/images/people/tom_white.jpg" border="0", align="left" /><p>
I've bumped into consistent hashing a couple of times lately. The paper that introduced the idea (<a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/karger97consistent.html">Consistent Hashing and Random Trees: Distributed Caching Protocols for Relieving Hot Spots on the World Wide Web</a> by <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/karger/">David Karger</a> <i>et al</i>) appeared ten years ago, although recently it seems the idea has quietly been finding its way into more and more services, from Amazon's <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2007/10/amazons_dynamo.html">Dynamo</a> to <a href="http://www.danga.com/memcached/">memcached</a> (courtesy of <a href="http://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a>). So what is consistent hashing and why should you care?
</p>

<p>
The need for consistent hashing arose from limitations experienced while running collections of caching machines - web caches, for example. If you have a collection of <i>n</i> cache machines then a common way of load balancing across them is to put object <i>o</i> in cache machine number <i>hash(o)</i> mod <i>n</i>. This works well until you add or remove cache machines (for whatever reason), for then <i>n</i> changes and <i>every object is hashed to a new location</i>. This can be catastrophic since the originating content servers are swamped with requests from the cache machines. It's as if the cache suddenly disappeared. Which it has, in a sense. (This is why you should care - consistent hashing is needed to avoid swamping your servers!)
</p>

<p>
It would be nice if, when a cache machine was added, it took its fair share of objects from all the other cache machines. Equally, when a cache machine was removed, it would be nice if its objects were shared between the remaining machines. This is exactly what consistent hashing does - <i>consistently</i> maps objects to the same cache machine, as far as is possible, at least.
</p>

<p>
The basic idea behind the consistent hashing algorithm is to hash both objects and caches using the same hash function. The reason to do this is to map the cache to an interval, which will contain a number of object hashes. If the cache is removed then its interval is taken over by a cache with an adjacent interval. All the other caches remain unchanged.
</p><h3>Demonstration</h3>

<p>
Let's look at this in more detail. The hash function actually maps objects and caches to a number range. This should be familiar to every Java programmer - the <code>hashCode</code> method on <code>Object</code> returns an <code>int</code>, which lies in the range -2<sup>31</sup> to  2<sup>31</sup>-1. Imagine mapping this range into a circle so the values wrap around. Here's a picture of the circle with a number of objects (1, 2, 3, 4) and caches (A, B, C) marked at the points that they hash to (based on a diagram from <a href="http://www8.org/w8-papers/2a-webserver/caching/paper2.html">Web Caching with Consistent Hashing</a> by David Karger <i>et al</i>):

<p>
To find which cache an object goes in, we move clockwise round the circle until we find a cache point. So in the diagram above, we see object 1 and 4 belong in cache A, object 2 belongs in cache B and object 3 belongs in cache C. Consider what happens if cache C is removed: object 3 now belongs in cache A, and all the other object mappings are unchanged. If then another cache D is added in the position marked it will take objects 3 and 4, leaving only object 1 belonging to A.
</p>

</p>

<p>
This works well, except the size of the intervals assigned to each cache is pretty hit and miss. Since it is essentially random it is possible to have a very non-uniform distribution of objects between caches. The solution to this problem is to introduce the idea of "virtual nodes", which are replicas of cache points in the circle. So whenever we add a cache we create a number of points in the circle for it.
</p>

<p>
You can see the effect of this in the following plot which I produced by simulating storing 10,000 objects in 10 caches using the code described below. On the x-axis is the number of replicas of cache points (with a logarithmic scale). When it is small, we see that the distribution of objects across caches is unbalanced, since the standard deviation as a percentage of the mean number of objects per cache (on the y-axis, also logarithmic) is high. As the number of replicas increases the distribution of objects becomes more balanced. This experiment shows that a figure of one or two hundred replicas achieves an acceptable balance (a standard deviation that is roughly between 5% and 10% of the mean).

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>
For completeness here is a simple implementation in Java. In order for consistent hashing to be effective it is important to have a hash function that <a href="http://problemsworthyofattack.blogspot.com/2007/10/mixing-with-md5.html">mixes</a> well. Most implementations of <code>Object</code>'s <code>hashCode</code> do <i>not</i> mix well - for example, they typically produce a restricted number of small integer values - so we have a <code>HashFunction</code> interface to allow a custom hash function to be used. MD5 hashes are recommended here.
</p>

<pre>
import java.util.Collection;
import java.util.SortedMap;
import java.util.TreeMap;

public class ConsistentHash&lt;T&gt; {

 private final HashFunction hashFunction;
 private final int numberOfReplicas;
 private final SortedMap&lt;Integer, T&gt; circle = new TreeMap&lt;Integer, T&gt;();

 public ConsistentHash(HashFunction hashFunction, int numberOfReplicas,
     Collection&lt;T&gt; nodes) {
   this.hashFunction = hashFunction;
   this.numberOfReplicas = numberOfReplicas;

   for (T node : nodes) {
     add(node);
   }
 }

 public void add(T node) {
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; numberOfReplicas; i++) {
     circle.put(hashFunction.hash(node.toString() + i), node);
   }
 }

 public void remove(T node) {
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; numberOfReplicas; i++) {
     circle.remove(hashFunction.hash(node.toString() + i));
   }
 }

 public T get(Object key) {
   if (circle.isEmpty()) {
     return null;
   }
   int hash = hashFunction.hash(key);
   if (!circle.containsKey(hash)) {
     SortedMap&lt;Integer, T&gt; tailMap = circle.tailMap(hash);
     hash = tailMap.isEmpty() ? circle.firstKey() : tailMap.firstKey();
   }
   return circle.get(hash);
 }

}
</pre>

<p>
The circle is represented as a sorted map of integers, which represent the hash values, to caches (of type <code>T</code> here).
When a <code>ConsistentHash</code> object is created each node is added to the circle map a number of times (controlled by <code>numberOfReplicas</code>). The location of each replica is chosen by hashing the node's name along with a numerical suffix, and the node is stored at each of these points in the map.
</p>

<p>
To find a node for an object (the <code>get</code> method), the <i>hash value of the object</i> is used to look in the map. Most of the time there will not be a node stored at this hash value (since the hash value space is typically much larger than the number of nodes, even with replicas), so the next node is found by looking for the first key in the tail map. If the tail map is empty then we wrap around the circle by getting the first key in the circle.
<h3>Usage</h3>So how can you use consistent hashing? You are most likely to meet it in a library, rather than having to code it yourself. For example, as mentioned above, memcached, a distributed memory object caching system, now has clients that support consistent hashing. Last.fm's <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.net/development/ketama/">ketama</a> by <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/RJ/">Richard Jones</a> was the first, and there is now a <a href="http://bleu.west.spy.net/%7Edustin/projects/memcached/">Java implementation</a> by <a href="http://bleu.west.spy.net/%7Edustin/">Dustin Sallings</a> (which inspired my simplified demonstration implementation above). It is interesting to note that it is only the client that needs to implement the consistent hashing algorithm - the memcached server is unchanged. Other systems that employ consistent hashing include <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/chord/">Chord</a>, which is a distributed hash table implementation, and Amazon's Dynamo, which is a key-value store (not available outside Amazon).

I've raved about the MapReduce parallel programming model in the <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/tomwhite/archive/2005/09/mapreduce.html">past</a>, and Apache Hadoop (the framework for running MapReduce applications), and Amazon's compute and storage webservices (EC2 and S3).

</p>

<p>
The nice thing is that you can fire up a fair sized Hadoop cluster (20 nodes is the current limit on <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2">EC2</a>) in minutes and run it just for as long as you need to run your job - you pay by the hour. EC2 is still in limited beta and has had long waiting lists to get on it, but recently they <a href="http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/message.jspa?messageID=61999#61999">cleared the backlog</a>, so if you're interested in trying it out, now might be a good time.

        <i><!--  | 0 --><p>
The long-awaited final version of <a href="http://www.jmock.org/">jMock 2</a> was released today. There are some big changes since version one. For example, you can now write
</p>

<pre><code>Cat cat = mock(Cat.class);</pre></code>

<p>
and then set expectations on the returned <code>cat</code> object itself:
</p>

<pre><code>checking(new Expectations() {{
    one(cat).miaow();
}});</pre></code>

<p>
(This means that the <code>miaow</code> method is expected to be called exactly once on the <code>cat</code> object.)
</p>

<p>
This change means that you can refactor your method names without breaking your tests, unlike jMock 1 where the method names were strings:
</p>

<pre><code>Mock mockCat = mock(Cat.class);
mockCat.expects(once()).method("miaow")</pre></code>

<p>
You may have noticed that the new syntax is a little weird (check out the double braces, and how e.g. <a href="http://www.jmock.org/returning.html">will modifiers</a> need new statements), and it may take a little getting used to, but I think it's worth it for the IDE completion and refactoring support. For example, in test driven mode I can write the name of the method that doesn't yet exist then get my IDE to create the method for me.
</p>

<p>
The other nice thing is the <a href="http://www.jmock.org/matchers.html">integration</a> with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hamcrest/">Hamcrest</a> (a library of matchers that <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/tomwhite/archive/2006/12/hamcrest_1.html">I've written about before</a>). My toolkit for writing new unit tests now includes:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Hamcrest for making flexible assertions.</li>
<li>jMock 2 for defining expected behaviour.</li>
<li><a href="http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2007/02/tott-naming-unit-tests-responsibly.html">Responsible Naming</a> for understanding what the test does.</li>
