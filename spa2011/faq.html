<h3>Help, I've never led a session before?</h3>
<p>Don't worry - the most important thing is to have a good idea - either for the topic to be discussed or the format and process of the session or ideally both! You will need to capture your ideas in to a short web-based form to give the Programme Review Committee the information they will need to assess the session. <br />
<a name="exampleproposals"><br />
</a>We provide examples of previous successful proposals to allow you to see the best way to present the information needed.</p>

<h3>What makes for a good session proposal?</h3>
<p>A good session proposal will show that you have a clear and interesting idea and that you have thought sufficiently about how the session will operate to ensure that all participants will be able to achieve the stated objectives of the session. To maximise the chances of the session being accepted on to the programme:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ensure the subject matter is relevant to the SPA participants.</li>
    <li>Make it clear what knowledge of the subject you will bring to the session and what experience you expect your participants to have.</li>
    <li>Clearly describe the process for the learning experience. A high degree of interactivity is likely to improve the rating of the proposal.</li>
    <li>Reflect on your own proposal using the sample <a href="/spa2011/uploads/file/reviewformsample.pdf">Review Form</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Look at some of the <a href="#exampleproposals">proposals</a> which have been successful in the past for suggestions on how best to present your proposal for the different types of session.</p>
<h3>What's all this about shepherding?</h3>
<p>All sessions that are accepted onto the SPA Conference programme are allocated a "shepherd". She/he acts as an independent 3rd party who will give you help and advice on your session as it progresses. The SPA/OT series of conferences has promoted a philosophy of working together in sessions that encourage learning through involvement. There are many way to do this, all rather different from the usual format of presentations, and they have proved popular and effective. However, this does require additional techniques and practices to run effective interactive sessions and these "tricks of the trade" are not easily picked up as most of us do not attend such sessions during our work. The shepherding relationship teams up presenters with experienced session leaders who can collaborate in making sessions truly effective.<br />
<br />
The Shepherd's chief role is that of a consultant and mentor, rather than a collaborator or helper. They should ask and answer questions, make suggestions, and refer to relevant sources of information rather than write notes or draw diagrams. They may not be an expert in your subject matter, but they will know a lot about how SPA conference sessions run best. They will also act as your conscience to ensure you meet deadlines for the submission of materials etc.</p>
<h3>How are the session proposals reviewed?</h3>
<p>The session proposals are reviewed by a panel of Software Practioners most of whom have lead very successful sessions at SPA and other conferences. Each proposal is reviewed independently by a number of reviewers. The reviews rate the session using a standardised <a href="/spa2011/uploads/file/reviewformsample.pdf">review form</a>. These reviews then form the basis of a ranking exercise carried about by small panels of reviewers. This then allows us to build a balanced and varied programme based on the best proposals across different topic areas and session types. <br />
<br />
The final construction of the programme is the responsibility of the Programme Chair. They will also work to avoid a single presenter appearing too many times on the programme while balancing the range of topics, session formats and durations.</p>
<h3>When will I know if my session has been accepted?</h3>
<p>We will inform you of the results of the review by 21st March. You will receive copies of completed review forms for your sessions to assist you in further work on your session and to help you improve future submissions.<br />
<br />
The decision of the Programme Chair regarding your session will be one of the following:<br />
<br />
<strong>Accepted on to Programme:</strong> At this point your session will be included in the Programme. You will then be expect to comply with the <a href="/spa2011/terms-and-conditions.html" title="Terms and Conditions">conditions</a> of being a session leader including meeting all booking and materials deadlines. If you fail to comply we reserve the right to remove your session from the programme at a later date.<br />
<br />
<strong>Provisionally accepted on to the Programme:</strong> The Programme Chair would like to include your session in the programme, but the review process will have highlighted some areas of the proposal that need further discussion or modification. <br />
<br />
<strong>Held on reserve list:</strong> Since we often have a number of high quality session that we are not able to schedule into the programme initially, we ask to keep some session on a reserve list. We will keep you updated as the continuing status of your proposal while it is on this list. <br />
<br />
<strong>Not accepted:</strong> We are not able to accept all sessions submitted even if they are of a high quality, due to our desire to create a well balanced and appropriately varied programme. If your session was not accepted, we encourage you to still attend and participate in the conference. You may also find you can organise a Birds-of-a-Feather session around the topic you wished to consider.</p>
