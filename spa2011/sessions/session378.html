	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Alistair Cockburn and others have reported on the varying effectiveness of<br />
various forms of communication and the importance of communication in the<br />
success of a software project (see<br />
http://alistair.cockburn.us/Characterizing+people+as+non-linear,+first-order+components+in+software+development).<br />
These communcation variations are usually discussed in terms of the<br />
limitations imposed upon two parties who are trying to reach a<br />
common understanding of some piece of design work. As characteristics of<br />
communication are lost, such as vocal inflections, quick question and<br />
answer cycles, shared culture, and so on, the quality and quantity of<br />
a group's output declines.<br />
<br />
Although many software practitioners know and accept the effects of these<br />
communication difficulties, we often get little chance to experience the<br />
difference that small changes in communication can have on the cohesiveness<br />
of a team and the quality of their work. This session provides a way to try<br />
out these variations in a controlled environment and reflect on the effect<br />
they have on our ability to work.<br />
<br />
Participants will work together in small groups of around three or four<br />
under time and communication constraints to complete a creative task. The<br />
task involves completing a comic strip in which the group is provided with<br />
a starting point (a single panel from which to start) and a goal (the final<br />
panel of the strip). The group needs to work together to create a series of<br />
panels that completes a story of the group's devising and connects the<br />
starting panel to the goal panel.  As this is not an exercise in artistic<br />
ability the comic strips will be simple stick figure drawings much like<br />
those used in the online comic XKCD (http://xkcd.com).<br />
<br />
The groups will all be working under communication constraints that attempt<br />
to model those possibly encountered in the real world. Constraints will<br />
range from only being communication via small written notes (to simulate<br />
teams that can only communicate via email) to one-way communication from a<br />
controlling member of the team (to simulate siloed teams with a single<br />
point of control). Each group will be given the chance to try each<br />
variation of communication. After each round of work the groups will come<br />
back together to hold a common retrospective and discuss their experience<br />
and the comic strip they were able to produce, or not able to produce as<br />
the case may be.<br />

circumstances they may find themselves in.</td></tr>

out of the session (a better understanding of how people communicate with<br />
each other). They will then explain the communication structures selected<br />
for simulation and what these structures are modelling from the real world.<br />
The process that will be used for the session is then explained and any<br />
questions from the participants will be answered.<br />
<br />
The participants are next split into groups of three to four. Each group is<br />
assigned one of the communication structures and a starting and ending<br />
comic panel. The groups are given five minutes to work on completing the<br />
comic strip. After the five minutes have passed the groups are brought<br />
together for a retrospective.  This process is repeated four times so that<br />
each participant has an opportunity to try each communication method.</td></tr>
