	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Coaching often focusses on performance, or effectiveness, or on educating teams and individuals in particular tools, techniques and processes. We think Innovation is a missing piece of the puzzle.<br />
<br />
Innovation is not just about creating exciting new product concepts, feature definitions and business ideas. We use our innovation muscles every time we solve a problem in technology, design, collaboration, process. A team with innovation at its core is willing to learn, to create new ways of working individually, as a team, and with other groups, and to respond to changes in its social, technical and organisational environment. We believe this level of group creativity is essential to effective self-organization: without it energy flags and practices become stale, particularly as often we fall back on a limited and unhelpful set of tools for fostering innovation. There are many better ways of facilitating creativity than the "Brainstorming Session".<br />

The workshop will<br />
<br />
* explore the role of creativity in the day-to-day work of teams<br />
* motivate the exercises by reviewing some of the research in innovation and group creativity<br />
* provide an opportunity to try a number of coaching and workshop techniques for enhancing innovation<br />
* invite participants to provide scenarios from their own experience with which to explore these techniques</td></tr>
