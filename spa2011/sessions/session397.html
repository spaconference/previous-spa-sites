<br />
As with any practice, there are ways to get it wrong, e.g. by applying CI in a check box fashion or attempting to follow CI by the book without understanding where to adapt practices. <br />
<br />
The presenter has experienced dos and don'ts of CI while helping clients to improve their Continuous Integration practices and would like to share experiences with a group of peers. <br />

After a brief introduction into CI and CD, the presenter proposes topics to be discussed in the groups. The participants of the workshop are invited to propose further topics and prioritise the full set of topics. Then, about four topics are explored and groups share their findings. When working on a particular topic, participants are encouraged to look for success stories, failures and lessons learnt and puzzles. <br />
<br />
After the conference, the findings are made available on a SPA Wiki page.</td></tr>
