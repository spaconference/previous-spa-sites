	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Go is a strategic board game of Chinese origin. Its rules are utterly simple, there are just four of them. Nevertheless the resulting games can be very complex and highly interesting. While in the past Go was considered to be one of the four arts of cultivated gentlemen in the past, these days a lot of Mathematicians and computer scientists seem to gravitate to the game.  <br />
<br />
The session offers a Go experience for a wide range of participants. Beginners start by playing the corner exercise, i.e. by competing for a single corner of the board instead of playing a full game. For those beyond the corner exercise, different board sizes and a handicap allow for meaningful matches across a wide range of playing skills.<br />
<br />
The presenter would *not* expect a paying audience to attend the conference because of this session. Nevertheless, the presenter has experienced people taking a break from more serious topics in the course of previous SPA conferences and could see this session fitting into a late afternoon slot or possibly an evening *diversion*. The duration of the session should not  be less than 90 mins though.<br />

Understanding the trade offs to consider when making a move helps improving decision making. Last but not least, observing behavioural patterns in the course of a game provides valuable feedback that can be applied in other contexts as well. The latter two benefits admittedly take some time to materialise but have been experienced the presenter.</td></tr>
