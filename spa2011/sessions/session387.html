	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">A common challenge many of us face is how to build trust on software development teams. Trust seems like a fluffy concept and so it's not always obvious how to foster trust within a software team. This is a concern because a lack of trust deters us from collaboration and teamwork.<br />
 <br />
You can take some practical steps to improve trust. To identify these, we must first develop an understanding of the nature of trust relationships at work. Come to this workshop to explore factors that help and hinder the development of trust in software development organisations and what steps you can take to improve the situation.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Audience background:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">This workshop does not require participants to have specific skills. We'll be reflecting on the experience of workshop participants in how lack of trust manifests in software development organisations so it would help if people have relevant stories to tell. This workshop is relevant to any job role - architects, designers, developers, managers, testers, etc.</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Benefits of participating:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Opportunity to share your experience about situations where trust flourished or was lacking.<br />
Discover the factors that increase and reduce trust in situations. Learn to apply force-field analysis to explore driving and restraining forces related to building trust. Learn from personal experiences within the workshop group.<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">The workshop starts with an introduction to the topic of trust with audience interaction encouraged.<br />
<br />
Force-field analysis is introduced as a tool that can be used to explore driving and restraining forces related to a desired change. We will do a worked example to demonstrate how to apply this technique in a coaching situation.<br />
<br />
We move into groupwork around tables to draw force-field charts based on experience of individuals in the workgroups.<br />
<br />
We create a gallery of force-field charts on the walls (if allowed otherwise on table tops) and encourage the groups to circulate in a “world cafe” fashion.<br />
<br />
We ask people to return to their tables for a debrief of lessons learned. Capturing main points in poster form.</td></tr>

I have also give some talks on the Trust Equation. However, I'm changing the workshop format to make it more participatory and reducing the time allocated to introducing the topic at the beginning.</td></tr>
