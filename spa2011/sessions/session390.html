	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">The problem with Continuous Integration is that you still have to integrate. Pair Programming is also constrained: you can’t have more than two, you can’t have fewer than two, and actually you don’t quite have two. Maybe we can do better.<br />
<br />
Using a dynamic language, it is possible to create an environment where we are no longer limited by the number of people who can comfortably fit around a single workstation. An entire team of programmers can collaborate simultaneously on the same live code base; they never need to integrate because they always are. In this hands-on workshop, we will borrow from the hunting strategies of wolves to take Extreme Programming practices and turn them all the way up to 11.<br />
<br />
To facilitate the exercise, we will use a web-based development environment. The focus of the workshop, however, is not on the technology but rather on the benefits and challenges of real-time collaboration. Does this practice make conventional Agile approaches look cumbersome or does it lead to disaster? To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we will ask our wolf packs to complete a series of tasks following the process.</td></tr>

This workshop will help them to examine their existing development practices from a new perspective.</td></tr>

They will first be guided through the process and then given the opportunity to complete one or more iterations independently. Each pack will be assisted by a Smalltalk expert who will provide mentoring and expertise on the language and development environment. After the session, there will be time for group discussion and feedback.</td></tr>

Some fairly successful ones were for instance at SPA 2010 (as a BoF session), XTC, XP Days Benelux and Germany…<br />
After having had a BoF session at SPA 2010, it was suggested to run a longer session, e.g. on the Sunday afternoon.<br />
