Professionals in the software community will recognize that, on one hand, they are already dependent on stories as an essential tool:<br />
	•Scenarios and Play Scripts for business strategic planning, innovation, and change.<br />
	•Scenarios are stories about objects working together to accomplish tasks for ‘requirements discovery and documentation.’<br />
	•Object-orientation uses stories to define and design objects as well as for capturing how objects interact to complete tasks.<br />
	•Use-cases are formalized stories. UML provides formal diagrams for capturing and representing stories.<br />
	•Agile relies on the User Story to frame a unit of work and to limn the nature of the work to be done.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, it’s equally clear to those same professionals that we fail utterly to train them in the savoir-faire of story collection and construction and that real ‘stories’ degenerate into ‘requirements.’ We also fail to help professionals hone basic intellectual skills (such as prediction, modeling, evaluation, diagnostics, or planning) through the solicitation and analysis of stories. <br />
The underlying premise of this tutorial is that we learn (and teach/lead) most effectively with just-in-time stories, engaging and memorable tales relevant to the matters at hand, rather than lectures, or instruction manuals, or passively watching demonstrations.<br />
<br />
This long tutorial, with a maximum amount of time devoted to hands-on experimentation, lays out the basics in story construction and types of stories most useful to software development and the interface between IT and end users. <br />
