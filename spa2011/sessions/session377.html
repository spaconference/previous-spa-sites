	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Cucumber provides a lot of flexibility with a unconventional construction model. Regular expressions rather than functions which are used to group bundles of test code which ideally should be reusable in many contexts. Also with a very open grammer the Gherkin language provides us with lots of different ways to express plaintext specifications. Within this session I want to examine some of the good and bad patterns that I have been collating from talking to people about Cucumber and Gherkin. Building a discussion around why these patterns are bad/good and see if the group can collaboratively identify new patterns from their own experience.</td></tr>

* Group activities: small groups will discuss what they think the acceptance criteria should be, with encouragement to use pens and paper for sketching and thinking about the user interface. The Cucumber features will be written up on pen and paper.<br />
* Presentation slides - Setting the scene, providing the groups with little hints and tips to help them though the tasks.<br />
* Group discussion - The groups will stick their features to the wall and then in turn the different groups will rotate around the features discussing anything they see that is good or bad. Sharing any important learnings with the whole group at the end. </td></tr>
