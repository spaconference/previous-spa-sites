Both are essential and inseparable. We constantly improve our technical skills to make sure we create bug-free software. We tend to expand less energy on debugging our relationships. Ultimately, the value we are able to deliver as software developers depends on how effective we are in working with our stakeholders. No software grows in isolation. In this workshop you'll be able to hone your skills of handling difficult conversations with deliberate practice through active role play to make sure that nothing stands between your technically perfect solutions and the needs of your customers.<br />
