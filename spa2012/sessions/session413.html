<br />
The idea is to have each pair program up a common example, an Engima machine, but with different starting conditions. Some will be environmental, such as functional vs. OO languages, others will be more about approach, for example:<br />
- introduce domain types immediately<br />
- extract domain types from strings and integers<br />
- model the physical machine (rotors, etc)<br />
- don't model the physical machine<br />
- "TDD as if you meant it" style<br />
<br />
We can also force the initial test choices, for example:<br />
- a one rotor machine completely implemented<br />
- a minimal machine with 3 rotors<br />
<br />
We will ask people to checkpoint the code at intervals during the session to see how the design is evolving. We could try gathering some arbitrary statistics, such as number of lines, classes, methods, etc. <br />

The timing is short, but our experience at XpDay was that people got enough done to give us some initial feedback. If it gets scheduled early and people are interested, they might want to carry on through the rest of the conference.</td></tr>
