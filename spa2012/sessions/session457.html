However, there is little focus in much software development iterature around encoding business process. Many software development languages and environments are not well suited to encoding or describing business process.<br />
Why is BPMN (Business Process Management Notation) not as familiar to developers and designers as UML and ERD diagrams? Can you really let busines people loose on a BPM tool and get something you can develop from? What happens about the agile development process you have built up based on Java/C#/Ruby etc?<br />
This session explores what we mean by business processes and brings some tales from the frontline in one organization where BPM met agile. Come along to find out which one won…<br />
