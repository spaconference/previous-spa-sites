	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">"TDD" is probably the highest profile and most widely adopted technical practice from the Agile toolkit. <br />
<br />
But, I see a lot of this sort of thing:<br />
• Think up a design<br />
• Write a bunch of tests that say the design exists<br />
• Write the implementation<br />
• Test, debug, test, debug, test, debug, test, debug, debug, test, debug, test, debug <br />
• Write a TODO saying to refactor<br />
<br />
That's not really TDD. In this session we will try doing this:<br />
• Add a test<br />
– The very simplest test you can think of<br />
• See it fail<br />
• Make all tests pass<br />
– By writing the least code possible<br />
• Refactor<br />
- design thinking goes here<br />
• Repeat until done<br />
<br />
With some very strict rules in place about what the "simplest" test and the "least" code are, to force the Tests to really Drive the Development.</td></tr>

<br />
NB This is a hands-on session so attendees should bring a laptop or be prepared to share. No specific language or tools need be installed beforehand but attendees should bring a machine on which they can do programming of some kind within an automated unit test environment. </td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Benefits of participating:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Gain an appreciation of the possibilities of TDD as a design tool. Gain an understanding of the kinds of problem-solving strategies that other programmers use in applying TDD<br />
<br />
Previous attendees at these sessions have said things like this: "I’d highly recommend [TDD as if You Meant It] as something to do on a relatively regular basis to help refresh your TDD muscle memory" — Rob Bowley<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>History:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">this was one of the most talked-about sessions at Software Craftsmanship 2009 http://parlezuml.com/softwarecraftsmanship/sessions/tdd_as_if_you_meant_it.htm and was popular at Spa 2010 I have since run and refined the session at Agile Cambridge ( http://www.infoq.com/presentations/TDD-as-if-You-Meant-It )  and XP Day 2011 as well as at private events.<br />
<br />
It has been run subsequently by others at various conferences and gatherings and has become a recognised "advanced TDD" exercise for code dojos and code retreats. http://coderetreat.org/facilitating/activities/tdd-as-if-you-meant-it </td></tr>
