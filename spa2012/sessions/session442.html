<br />
Join us to learn about Tribal Leadership, a model for leveraging natural groups to create organisations that thrive. Learn how to transform your work experience into what you want it to be by focusing on language and behaviour through different stages: from Despairing Hostility (“Life sucks”) to Tribal Pride (“We’re great they’re not”) and finally to Innocent Wonderment (“We’re great and so are they”).<br />
<br />
OBJECTIVES<br />
Learn about the Tribal Leadership Model<br />
Get ideas of how the model can be used to articulate an Agile team's journey<br />
Give people ideas for becoming more effective in terms of sharing and teamwork<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">About the exercises This session is made up of two kinds exercises.<br />
<br />
The Origami Exercise<br />
This consists of 3 rounds. Each round is made up of PLAY (folding of cranes) followed by a DEBRIEF (identify the stage of your tribe/yourself based on what you saw, heard and experienced during Play section). Note: The choice of the peace crane is deliberate. It is sufficiently advanced as to be quite challenging for many people. This creates the pressure necessary to bring out an individuals’s preferred language and behaviour in real life, thus enriching the learning experience by making it more meaningful and relevant.<br />
<br />
Round 1 - Represents the tribe forming stage. People are set the goal of producing as many peace cranes as possible to exchange with other tribes for goods. They playback the language they heard during play in order to identify the tribe’s current stage. The tribe has the opportunity to brainstorm and select improvement actions to upgrade their tribe to be applied in the next round.<br />
<br />
Round 2 - The goal of producing as many cranes remains the same. They playback the behaviour they saw during play in order to identify the tribe’s current stage. This may or not be different to the finding from the first round. The tribe has the opportunity to brainstorm and select improvement actions to upgrade their tribe to be applied in the next round.<br />
<br />
Round 3 - The goal of producing as many cranes remains the same. This time, each tribe member considers their personal language and behaviour to identify their personal stage. This may or may not differ from that of the tribe.<br />
<br />
Personal Assessment Exercise<br />
This follows on from the last round of the Origami exercise in which each tribe member has the opportunity to apply the theory of upgrading themselves from the current stage to the next. During this activity, participants are likely to see and draw parallels between their personal stage in the Origami Exercise in comparison to their personal stage at work and increase their awareness of their current stage is in real life at work.<br />
<br />
Storytelling and real-life examples During this session, I will also tell stories of individuals and teams (Agile and non-Agile) undergoing change and how using this model has helped us make sense of those experiences.</td></tr>
