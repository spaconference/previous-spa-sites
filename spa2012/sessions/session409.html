<br />
To realise the true power of patterns you have to write them.  And writing patterns is the best way to deepen your insight, and address your reader.  <br />
<br />
In this workshop you will write patterns in miniature.  We supply the problem, you supply the solution - and the words. Along the way you will understand how and why patterns work, see their variety, and learn practices that improve your writing skills.  Whether you want to write your own patterns, better understand other patterns or improve your writing and critical thinking skills this workshop is for you.<br />
<br />
Notes for reviewers:<br />
1. "We supply the problem" - we have a video (about milk) which contains all sorts of solutions and problems to work with.<br />
2. This is more than GoF patterns, we want people to write new patterns.  Obviously milk production is about more than the 23, if we open people's minds to that then good.<br />

Using this raw material the group breaks into smaller working groups who then apply the pattern format to the problems and solutions identified.  Facilitators circulate and advise on pattern form and writing.<br />
In the longest version of this workshop participants also take part in a mini-writers workshop; in 150 minutes we might be able to do one of these at most</td></tr>
