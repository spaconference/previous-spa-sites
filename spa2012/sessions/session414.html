	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">It’s hard to go anywhere without bumping into the “Cloud” these days.  Maybe it’s over-hyped or maybe it is a new paradigm for computation: either way, you can’t ignore it.  This workshop will explore people’s experiences with the Cloud and pull together themes based on their experiences, to help us all learn about the Cloud and what impact it might have on software development and related teams.<br />
<br />
The session will take Oxfam’s experience with the Cloud as its jumping-off point.  Oxfam spent some time exploring options such as Amazon EC2 and the Google App Engine in 2009.  It also virtualised many of its back-office applications (Finance and HR, Supporter Database, etc) in that year.  Then in 2010 it decided to explore moving its web applications (website, e-commerce, intranet, etc) from the 30-odd servers in its web hosting facility to a cloud-based facility.  That migration is now complete and we’ve got a lot of lessons learned to trigger the discussion.<br />
<br />
Our objectives are to:<br />
   * Gather people’s experience of working with the Cloud (or of why they’ve chosen not to work with the Cloud) and identify key themes about how it has impacted the way that software development and related teams work<br />
   * Demonstrate and explore a story-telling technique that could also be used to gather and structure lessons learned, user requirements, or other information, in different contexts<br />

   * Seed the discussion with the story of Oxfam’s experience of working with the Cloud<br />
   * Gather other people’s stories about their experience with the cloud using a technique called Anecdote Circles<br />
   * Analyse these stories and extract underlying themes<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Detailed timetable:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">00:00-00:10  Introduction:  Set the scene and discuss who’s here and what they hope to get from the workshop.<br />
<br />
00:10-00:25 Oxfam’s story:  Graham will tell Oxfam’s story of its journey into the cloud and the impact that this has had on various teams within the organisation.  Stewart will then pull out key lessons learned / themes from this story.<br />
<br />
00:25-00:55 Anecdote circles:  We will break into smaller groups for people to tell their stories about moving to and working with the Cloud (or their stories about why they’ve chosen not to move into the Cloud).  We will use the Cognitive Edge (of Cynefin fame) technique described at http://www.cognitive-edge.com/method.php?mid=41 to run this part of the workshop.  (Graham is an accredited Cognitive Edge practitioner.)  This will give us a mass of stories, each outlined on a "hexie" post-it note.<br />
<br />
00:55-02:15 Extract Themes:  We will take these stories and identify common themes within them using the technique for “Social Construction of Emergent Properties” described at http://www.cognitive-edge.com/method.php?mid=42.  This part of the workshop will go through 3 broad phases:<br />
  (1) Identify subjects & issues.  We'll all look at the mass of stories gathered above & identify subjects covered by / issues raised by each story, again writing each subject/issue onto a hexie post-it.  We'll then cluster the subjects & issues, and give each cluster a name.<br />
  (2) Describe attributes of these subjects & issues.  We'll look at each cluster and describe polar opposites applying to each issue -- what might an optimist say about it, and what might a pessimist say about it?<br />
  (3) Cluster these attributes & hence describe key themes that emerge from people's experience with & perceptions of the Cloud.  In what respects is the Cloud a good thing, or what gotchas does one need to look out for?<br />
<br />
The 80 minutes for these activities will probably go approximately 50% into (1), including tea or coffee break, and 25% apiece into (2) and (3), but the exact timing will depend on where the group directs its energy -- Graham & Stewart will facilitate the process & help keep people circulating around all the post-its, clusters, etc, so that we get a good range of perspectives on each of the stories & themes.<br />
<br />
02:15-02:30 Wrap Up:  We will step back and look at the themes that emerged over the course of the workshop, giving them names and discussing their attributes and what they might mean for software development and related teams.  (This will also give us our output from the session.)  It’s also likely that recognising these themes will kick off a new round of storytelling…<br />
