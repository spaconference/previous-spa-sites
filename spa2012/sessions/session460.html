	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Test driven development (TDD) is a technique that emerged as one of the fundamental technical practices of Extreme Programming (XP). It is therefore often wrongly assumed that it can only be applied to Java and dynamic languages, but with the right framework I have found that it is equally applicable in just about any language - even graphical "languages" such as Datastage mappings.<br />
<br />
In this tutorial, I want to provide an introduction to TDD for embedded software - typically written in C and C++ for device drivers, controllers and so on in sometimes very demanding environments (e.g. safety critical, real-time, or highly resource-constrained). The exercises will involve using frameworks such as Unity, CppUnit and CppUtest to develop a series of library components.<br />
<br />
The techniques covered will include<br />
<br />
- test case selection<br />
- refactoring<br />
- stubs<br />
- mock objects<br />
<br />
If time permits, we will also take a look at a couple of static analysis tools to see how these can complement the dynamic test frameworks.</td></tr>
