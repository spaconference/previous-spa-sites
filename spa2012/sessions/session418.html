<br />
Gojko Adzic and I have been using this technique with a number of our clients, with consistently valuable results. In this session, I'll explain the key aspects of effect mapping and teach you how to facilitate effect mapping workshops.<br />
<br />
Effect maps provide an excellent level of visibility to stakeholders and help drive software projects towards delivering the right product with a high level of quality. The maps also facilitate the application of several techniques of agile planning, product design, prioritisation and scoping. We have found the combination of these techniques to be by far the most powerful way of managing iterative product development. <br />
<br />
