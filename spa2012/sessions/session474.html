<br />
We begin with a recap of the past five years experience at New Mexico Highlands University and the partnership between a private, for-profit an public entities that has evolved from that experience.<br />
<br />
An argument for why a new discipline - separate from traditional computer science, MIS, Informatics, and IT - will be made. <br />
<br />
The core of the report will focus on the educational setting and structure. The inspiration for this is the bottega where Leonardo da Vinci apprenticed and grew to acknowledged master and polymath:<br />
<br />
  ---  a studio in Renaissance Florence; a master and advanced apprentices; several arts being worked shoulder to shoulder: sculpture, painting, goldsmithing, even poetry with masters for each; a spectrum of younger apprentices eager to master one of them but eager also to learn another, or two. This the ideal of the bottega:<br />
<br />
 - a “storefront” where goods and services are produced and • delivered to paying customers<br />
 - a workshop simultaneously engaged in the craft, in building • the tools and discovering the techniques that advance and support the craft, and teaching that craft to apprentices<br />
 - a place noisy with multiple projects and activities; walls and • benches covered with tools and works in progress and exemplars of the craft <br />
 - an intellectual center that was a “must visit” for masters, • scientists, and thinkers visiting the area<br />
 - and an atmosphere that is very self-consciously multi-disciplinary, mixing theory and practice almost without differentiation ...<br />
