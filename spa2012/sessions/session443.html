	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Programming is insanely hard. It’s discipline. It’s learning your katas from inside out. It’s overcoming fear that you might write something buggy in a piece of software that will cost its owner millions of dollars. It is also fun, however. And while we do talk about it, we seldom do code for fun, just as a celebration of how much we love our coder’s life. This session is an attempt to change this. We’re going to code for fun. With the secret hope that some of the attendees will like what they’ll see, decide it’s the coolest thing to do, and make it happen everywhere on the planet.<br />
<br />
This session is a piece of coding performance. Although it is neither a workshop, a tutorial, a case study, a simulation, nor (God forbid) a think tank, the session duration is 75 minutes nonetheless. (Now that we think about it, it could actually be a tutorial on what NOT to try on a paid work).</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Audience background:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Designing the session, we have especially had in mind the coders who’ve been around for a year or two, and who may be deciding they’d rather be managers. We also have in mind the IT managers who might have lost touch with their inner programmer. Actually, we’d like to have with us any person who has the intuition the act of coding is a miracle in itself, but doesn’t know how to articulate it, or fears they might be wrong to have such intuitions. Or, to put it another way, anyone who suspects agile conferences are getting too serious.</td></tr>

- learn how to prepare a conference talk at the very last reasonable moment<br />
- throw out (other) crazy ideas<br />
- reach out with other coders (be they out of the closet or not)<br />
- have a good laugh</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">We, the performers, have prepared to perform a kata (we won't tell you which one, for the sake of not spoiling the surprise).  After a brief introduction of the performers and the exercise, participants will be asked to write on papers figures of style, users stories, or as a matter of fact any inane idea they’d like to see the performers execute. They can write as many as they want. They’re encouraged to be creative and to go over the top. The sky is the limit. All the pieces of paper go into a hat. The kata begins. Every ten minutes, someone draws at random a piece of paper from the hat and read it out loud. The organizers will execute the figure of style - or they will try, at least. Things might go well, or hairy, or surreal. We don’t know yet. But we’ll stop after 60 minutes of fun for a quick round of applause (and/or rotten vegetable throwing) and any questions the audience might have.</td></tr>

We've also be invited to present our work to the Netherland Devnology group (see review here: http://devnology.nl/nl/blog/7-verslagen/155-report-the-kata-in-the-hat), and to Paris Dorkbot.<br />
