1. Participants will carry out QC (Inspection) of a 'top level project requirements document,'  supplied by participants or by us, if necessary<br />
2. wrt basic rules of intelligibility.<br />
3.  We will measure major defect density, and <br />
4. extrapolate results to true density. <br />
5. We will compare results to a give Defect Level <br />
6. for Exit to next process<br />
<br />
Objectives<br />
Give participants practical experience in a powerful software project measurement technique, which can drive change, personal improvement, and real conformance to best practices (the standards we use in the QC process here for how to write (Rule) and levels of quality (exit level)<br />

<br />
5. conclusions 15 minutes (should the specification exit its process to next user, should it be repaired or totally rewritten?, what are consequences for the project time if whole document is released unchanged?)</td></tr>
