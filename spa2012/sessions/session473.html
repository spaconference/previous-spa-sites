<br />
What do I mean by live code? Maybe it is easiest to explain by what it is not. Most developers work with a language and environment that is file based. The code is stored in a set of files that are directly edited and then compiled to produce a running program. The code is an indirect representation of the running code. If you are lucky you will have a good debugging environment that will let you view the running application to see what is really happening. But the code itself is dead. In a live code system the code is always running and you can directly modify the running system. Changes to code immediately change the running system and they directly manipulate the application. In addition the values within the running system can be directly manipulated producing a experimental and exploratory approach to coding that is much more interactive.<br />
<br />
This workshop will provide an environment to explore and experience these ideas for yourself. You will work through a number of examples that should give you a feel of what it is like to work in these kind of environments.<br />
