They save time, help to build better products, can help difficult teams to collaborate and generally are more fun.  But introducing these games to an unreceptive or even receptive organisation can be a challenge.  Knowing which games to use and when to use them, getting stakeholder and team member buy-in, and bringing games out of product definition workshops and in to everyday/weekly meetings can feel like an uphill battle.<br />
<br />
In this collaborative session we'll explore ways to overcome these hurdles. We'll look at strategies to get comfortable with playing games as well as ways to get your entire organisation to embrace them. <br />
