	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">In this workshop you will learn what cognitive biases are and how they affect our thinking and decision making. We will run through the main types of bias (social, probability-related etc) and look at some of the more significant biases in detail, illustrating their effects.<br />
<br />
For most of the workshop participants will work in a small group to explore a particular question. For example: why would an organization resist changes that appear to make perfect sense? Each working group will produce a summary of their findings in poster form and present it back to the other groups.<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">We'll begin with a simple game that will (we hope!) demonstrate cognitive bias in action.<br />
Explain what cognitive biases are and mention a little of the experimental psychology background.<br />
Explain main types of cognitive bias.<br />
Explain several of the most significant biases and perhaps illustrate how they affect thinking.<br />
(despite all the "explain" bullet points above, this should be quite quick as many of these ideas can be explained in a sentence or two)<br />
Provide summary sheets listing biases and providing brief explanations.<br />
Ensure people are on sensible-sized tables (around 4-6 participants per table, preferably mixed groups)<br />
Distribute questions to tables. These will be of the form Why would an organization resist making changes that appear to make perfect sense? and Why would a team make an obviously harmful decision?. It may be possible to gather such questions from the audience TBD.<br />
Allow working groups time to familiarize themselves with the cognitive bias list.<br />
Allow some time for general discussion and scribing within the groups.<br />
Perhaps allow an initial presentation back to the whole group to solicit feedback TBD - very time-dependent<br />
Take a break<br />
Working groups will then produce a final poster, preferably using a systems diagram showing reinforcement effects among cognitive biases to explain the original question.<br />
Present posters.<br />
If there is extra time, pick one diagram and everyone discuss how particular feedback loops could be tackled to overcome widespread or entrenched biases affecting the question.<br />
We'll be on hand throughout the workshop to help with explaining particular biases, but we hope that the list we've chosen will be fairly self-explanatory. We'll also be able to help with the production of simple systems diagrams showing feedback effects.<br />
