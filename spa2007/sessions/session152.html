We know everything so well and it’s always “they” and “them” who make a mess of projects. In this tutorial we will do an exercise to measure our own abilities of dealing with estimation, planning, requirements, assumptions, design, test, defects, and interruptions, to see whether we really are any better than “they”. After the exercise we will talk about how the Evolutionary Project Management (Evo) approach is designed to quickly and effectively improve our abilities to deal with these issues in order to run our projects more successfully, with less defects and in much shorter time. Finally, we do an exercise organizing our own next week's work the Evo way. Learning to know what you can promise and then living up to your promises takes the quicksand from under your project.</td></tr>

Understanding why and how the Evolutionary approach supports projects to be routinely successful and on time.<br />
Experiencing how to organize your next weeks work the Evo way.<br />
You may even, after the conference, get some coaching-on-a-distance (if you can keep the discipline) about keeping your next weeks organized.</td></tr>

Then I will explain some, mainly psychological reasons for these weaknesses and how we can do something about it. Discussion is encouraged. At the end we'll do a second exrcise, planning our own work of the next week the Evo way. This will show how to put the theory into your own practice.</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>History:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">I've done the estimation exercise since september 2006 at least 10 times now, at conferences (Israel, Japan, Amsterdam, Gilb2007, USA) and with Evo introductions at clients, and it always works. It proves to be a rather humiliating, or let's call it a revealing experience. Still, because people deep in their hart know, they always see the outcome as a good learning experience. The tutorial I've done numerous times, although every time honed based on ongoing experiences. Organizing the work of the next week I'm teaching all the time, since about 2001. Coaching on a distance I've done several times, since about 2005.</td></tr>
