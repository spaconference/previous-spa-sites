	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Beck has described the investigation of scale-free properties of programs as the most intesesting topic in computer science today, and the experimental approach to the study of the properties as being the "science" in "computer science".<br />
<br />
Ongoing research has exposed the frequent occurence of various "scale-free" properties in the runtime object graph[1] and source code dependencies [2] of some OO systems. One of the presenters as also uncovered evidence that characteristic properties of the scale-free distribution of complexity in a program may vary in a consistant way depending on whether the code was written TDD or not[3].<br />
<br />
This offers the promise of an objective measure of the effect of adopting the practice of TDD. The hypotheses are that programs written TDD have a bias towards smaller methods than non-TDD codebases of similar size, and that the largest methods in TDD codebases are smaller than the largest methods in non-TDD codebases of similar size. It is asserted that these features of a codebase a beneficial and so represent a measure of the benefit of TDD. Cyclomatic Complexity is used as a measure or method size independent of coding quirks. Unit tests/CC is used as the measure of TDD-ness. <br />
<br />
During this session attendees will be presented with an overview of the scale-free properties of natural systems and of code, and an explanation of the proposed "TDD-ness" measures, whith an overview of the existing data. They will then use autoamted tools provided to measure code samples they bring with them (or download during the session) and add to the body of data. After some more data gathered the validity of the hypothesis will be reviewed, and the impact that such statistical measures of the impact of design practices discussed.<br />
<br />
Attendees will need to bring laptops with some form of connectivity (and the venue will need some bandwidth for them to connect to)<br />
