  <h1>FAQ: Leading a session at the SPA Conference</h1>
  <br>
  <h3>Why submit a session proposal?</h3>
  <ul> 
    <li>Your chance to influence the style and content of the conference. </li>
    <li>Opportunity to test ideas with other leading software professional in 
      a safe and supportive environment.</li>
    <li>Opportunity to attend Europe's leading conference for Software Practioners 
      at very low rates.</li>
    <li>Gain valuable feedback and new ideas on challenges facing your projects.</li>
    <li>Increases your own visibility and your organisation visibility within 
      the community of software professionals.</li>
  </ul> 
  <h3>Help, I've never led a session before?</h3>
  Don't worry - the most important thing is to have a good idea - either for the 
  topic to be discussed or the format and process of the session or ideally both! 
  You will need to capture your ideas in to a short web-based form to give the 
  Programme Review Committee the information they will need to assess the session. 
  <br>
  <a name="exampleproposals"><br>
  </a> We provide examples of previous successful proposals to allow you to see 
  the best way to present the information needed. <br>

        of the learning. They also often act to "ground" the session by forcing 
        participants to come to concrete conclusions. The outputs may initial 
        exists as flip-chart posters, index card sets etc. While these are welcome 
        and are fantastic to display in the public areas of the conference, SPA

        them on the conference wiki for use after the conference.</td>

  <h3>What makes for a good session proposal? </h3>
  A good session proposal will show that you have a clear and interesting idea 
  and that you have thought sufficiently about how the session will operate to 
  ensure that all participants will be able to achieve the stated objectives of 
  the session. To maximise the chances of the session being accepted on to the 
  programme: 
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure the subject matter is relevant to the SPA participants.</li>
    <li>Make it clear what knowledge of the subject you will bring to the session 
      and what experience you expect your participants to have.</li>
    <li>Clearly describe the process for the learning experience. A high degree 
      of interactivity is likely to improve the rating of the proposal.</li>
    <li>Reflect on your own proposal using the sample <a href="reviewformsample.pdf">Review 
      Form</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  Look at some of the <a href="#exampleproposals">proposals</a> which have been 
  successful in the past for suggestions on how best to present your proposal 
  for the different types of session. <br>
  <br>
  <h3>What's all this about shepherding?</h3>
  All sessions that are accepted onto the SPA Conference programme are allocated 
  a "shepherd". She/he acts as an independent 3rd party who will give you help 
  and advice on your session as it progresses. The SPA/OT series of conferences 
  has promoted a philosophy of working together in sessions that encourage learning 
  through involvement. There are many way to do this, all rather different from 
  the usual format of presentations, and they have proved popular and effective. 
  However, this does require additional techniques and practices to run effective 
  interactive sessions and these "tricks of the trade" are not easily picked up 
  as most of us do not attend such sessions during our work. The shepherding relationship 
  teams up presenters with experienced session leaders who can collaborate in 
  making sessions truly effective.<br>
  <br>
  The Shepherd's chief role is that of a consultant and mentor, rather than a 
  collaborator or helper. They should ask and answer questions, make suggestions, 
  and refer to relevant sources of information rather than write notes or draw 
  diagrams. They may not be an expert in your subject matter, but they will know 
  a lot about how SPA conference sessions run best. They will also act as your 
  conscience to ensure you meet deadlines for the submission of materials etc. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>How are the session proposals reviewed?</h3>
  The session proposals are reviewed by a panel of Software Practioners most of 
  whom have lead very successful sessions at SPA and other conferences. Each proposal 
  is reviewed independently by a number of reviewers. The reviews rate the session 
  using a standardised <a href="reviewformsample.pdf">review form</a>. These reviews 
  then form the basis of a ranking exercise carried about by small panels of reviewers. 
  This then allows us to build a balanced and varied programme based on the best 
  proposals across different topic areas and session types. <br>
  <br>
  The final construction of the programme is the responsibility of the Programme 
  Chair. They will also work to avoid a single presenter appearing too many times 
  on the programme while balancing the range of topics, session formats and durations. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>When will I know if my session has been accepted?</h3>
  We will inform you of the results of the review by the end of October. You will 
  receive copies of completed review forms for your sessions to assist you in 
  further work on your session and to help you improve future submissions.<br>
  <br>
  The decision of the Programme Chair regarding your session will be one of the 
  following:<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Accepted on to Programme:</strong> At this point your session will be 
  included in the Programme. You will then be expect to comply with the <a href="termsandconditions.html"> 
  conditions</a> of being a session leader including meeting all booking and materials 
  deadlines. If you fail to comply we reserve the right to remove your session 
  from the programme at a later date.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Provisionally accepted on to the Programme:</strong> The Programme Chair 
  would like to include your session in the programme, but the review process 
  will have highlighted some areas of the proposal that need further discussion 
  or modification. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Held on reserve list:</strong> Since we often have a number of high 
  quality session that we are not able to schedule into the programme initially, 
  we ask to keep some session on a reserve list. We will keep you updated as the 
  continuing status of your proposal while it is on this list. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Not accepted:</strong> We are not able to accept all sessions submitted 
  even if they are of a high quality, due to our desire to create a well balanced 
  and appropriately varied programme. If your session was not accepted, we encourage 
  you to still attend and participate in the conference. You may also find you 
  can organise a Birds-of-a-Feather session around the topic you wished to consider.
