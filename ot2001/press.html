<p><b><font face="Times"><font size=+1>Conference that tracks the changing
face of software</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times"><font size=+1>The OT conference has now been running
for nine years – providing a highly interactive environment in which software
professionals explore the cutting edge of software practice. It is now
firmly established as an event at which new ideas and fresh thinking on
software practice emerge.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font size=+1>The conference explores a broad range
of leading-edge subjects and issues encompassing technology, pioneering
software development and deployment practices, and innovative techniques
for managing software projects and the people that make up the project
team. In previous years, the conference has made significant contributions
to the advancement of frameworks, software architecture, patterns, and
internet technology.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font size=+1>The conference has also contributed
to educational and learning methods, establishing techniques many of which
have since been taken up by other event organisers. Based on a tradition
of active participation, the OT event uses a variety of innovative processes
for bringing people together to work and learn. The conference promotes
an interactive and reflective style that clearly distinguishes it from
marketing-led, vendor-driven conferences. Participants are encouraged to
share their knowledge and experience, and to learn from others, in a lively
and supportive environment</font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font size=+1>Drama workshops, Simulations, Think-tanks,
Goldfish bowls, Working groups, and impromptu Birds of a Feather sessions
have all been pioneered and developed at this conference during its 9-year
history.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br><font face="Times"><font size=+1></font></font>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times"><font size=+1>OT2001 takes place in Oxford, England
from 26 to 28 March 2001. XP, EJB, and XML all feature strongly in this
year’s conference programme, together with a host of other topics of direct
concern to today’s software professionals. In all, more than 40 sessions
are scheduled in the formal conference programme, and these will be supplemented
by a range of bird of a feather sessions and other meetings arranged during
the conference.</font></font>
