<TD VALIGN=TOP COLSPAN=5>The Object Technology conference has a tradition of active

participation. We encourage conference sessions that bring people together

to work and learn ñ in most cases, sessions are highly interactive, involving

participants and session leaders on an equal footing. The types of session

that typically make up the programme are described here, although if you

are proposing a session and want to do something different, we always welcome

new suggestions.</B></TD>

Workshops are sessions in which participants work in a structured

way on a topic set by the workshop organiser. At the end of the workshop,

the participants, in conjunction with the workshop organiser, would normally

produce and make available to other participants some conclusions and,

ideally, suggestions for avenues worthy of further investigation.</B> 

<P>Workshops may take many different forms and submitters are free to

propose their own structure and process. It is very important that proposals

are explicit about the process that will be followed. </B></P>

</TD>


<TD>A tutorial consists of a presentation on a clearly focussed topic

which is aimed at a defined category of software professional. For example

a tutorial could be aimed at experienced project managers, or at professionals

actively working on object-oriented design projects. You should have a

clear idea of what insights your participants will take away, and why they

will find these interesting.

<P>While tutorials are expected to contain a certain amount of formal

lecturing, you should try to incorporate a degree of interaction between

participants, for example by including a quiz or questionnaire.</P>

<TD>A goldfish bowl provides an effective means of exploring the breadth

of opinion on a given topic. The session is started by a small discussion

group (say four or five people) consisting of specially invited participants,

with the rest of the participants forming an audience. Spare places in

the discussion group are available, and members of the audience may take

up these places when they feel they have a contribution to make. Members

of the discussion group leave their places when they have had their say,

making room for new participants.

<P>The session should produce documentary output of the conclusions

reached, typically in the form of a poster.</P>

<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>A case study session aims to describe real-life

experiences and lessons learnt in implementing object technology. Discussion

of failures as well as successes is welcome. The experiences described

can be drawn from any aspect of object technology projects.


<P>Useful topics to address in a case study session would be:

background to why object technology was used; report on the experience

of using object technology; what went wrong and why; what went well

and why; what lessons have been learnt from the experience.

Given the complexity of the real-world environment in which we
practice software, it is often not possible to reflect clearly on the
way we work or to expweriment with new approaches. Using simulations
and games howwever allows us to think about these situations with
increased clarity. A simulation leader will be responsible for
producing a clear and concise summary of the purpose, rules, and
assumptions of the game. Some work on reflecting on the results of the
game and its implications for real-world practice should also be
included. The output from the sessions is likely to include both
summary results from the simulation and a summary of its real-world
implications.

</TD>



<TD>A think-tank session consists of a small group of people meeting

to solve a particular problem or to find an agreed position on some issue.

Think-tank sessions are intensive, focused and produce concrete output

in the form of a poster for other conference participants.

<P>The session leader is responsible for the process of the session,

for any materials that may be needed, and for ensuring that the poster

is produced.</P>

<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP colspan=4>A working group is formed to conduct a detailed

exploration of some aspect of object technology, to identify how that aspect

of the technology can be advanced, and then to put in motion the work needed

to achieve this advance. Working groups are run to encourage the exchange

of ideas between object technology practitioners with the aim of generating

or encouraging progress that is applicable to the software community at

large. A leader of a working group may require some pre-conference input

from participants (submission of a position paper or preparation of a pattern

for review, for example).

<P>Formal working group sessions take place on the afternoon of Sunday

1 April 2001, before the main conference. Groups may continue to meet during

and after the conference.</P>
