<B>Dear OT98 Participant,</B><BR>
<BR>
To stimulate discussion and interest before <A HREF="/ot98">OT98</A>, the Conference Committee
have decided to make use of the Internet to complement the event itself.
<P>If you have a topic you'd like to discuss at the conference, or if you are leading a scheduled session, we'd like you to provide:
<UL>
<LI><B>Some information about yourself</B> --- <A HREF="../bioform.html">fill in the form</A>. It would also be nice if you could provide a photo --- the form asks you about this.
<LI><B>A web "poster" summarising your session or topic.</B><A HREF="../posterguide.html">Click here for guidelines and advice.</A> 
<LI><B>Deliverables from working sessions will be posted at the end of the conference.</B>
<BR>Session-leaders are asked to ensure this happens.
<LI><B>Electronic discussion space is provided for each topic.</B>
</UL>
<P>If you aren't leading a scheduled session, you can still fix up an informal <A HREF="../bof.html">"BOF meeting"</A> on any topic you're interested in.

<P>
Scheduled session leaders are asked to provide input before December 25. This will
permit a good display of the conference topics to be visible as soon as
publicity starts.<BR> Additions and enhancements are encouraged up to and beyond the conference.
<P>
Thanks for your help. We hope that you'll get plenty of interesting responses
to your material. OT conferences have always been excellent for networking!<BR>
<BR>
<B>Looking forward to meeting you in April,<BR>
<BR>
