<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Session Leader: </FONT><A HREF="http://www.trireme.com/ot98/people/smrobertson-card.html"><FONT FACE="TIMES" SIZE=2>Stuart Robertson</FONT></A><FONT FACE="TIMES" SIZE=2> , Cumulus Systems Ltd.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Object oriented architectures and modelling methods are good at developing structural models for business applications. However it is in the area of modelling the dynamic behaviour of systems where complexity enters the notation of typical OO analysis methods. For example in modelling methods such as Syntropy or UML, the Type diagrams are relatively straight forward. However this can not be said of the state diagrams and related concepts, such as events and guards, that are typically used by such methods to model dynamic behaviour. Problems occur when trying to combine such methods within an architectural framework for the definition and execution of business processing. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This session will describe the experiences of Cumulus Systems in this area. Cumulus Systems is undertaking the design of a large-scale financial application for the capital markets. The architecture developed has introduced a framework for the modelling of Business Processes in a distributed OO environment which drives the actual execution of the corresponding processes. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The session will </P>

<UL>
<LI>describe the fundamental framework and the basic model for the definition of Business Processes implemented by Cumulus. </LI>
<LI>describe the relationship between Business Process Definitions and the Types defined by the business domain model </LI>
<LI>highlight the benefits of developing a generic framework for business processing</LI>
<LI>describe how the framework introduced enables the functionality of the system to be modified by a client organisation</LI>
<LI>describe our experiences with attempts to extend the model to introduce the concepts of states and  events</LI></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The session will attempt to address the question as to what extent such an application framework should utilise the concepts of state machines and related concepts introduced in modelling languages such as UML. Attendees will be encouraged to enter into a discussion on the questions raised by our experiences in this area.<I> </P>
