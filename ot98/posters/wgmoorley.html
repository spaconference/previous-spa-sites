<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>The gang-of-four's Observer pattern describes how we can define a one-to-many
dependency between objects so that, when the object changes, all its dependants
are notified of this change. The purpose of this dependency is to achieve
consistency of state between loosely coupled objects as exemplified by
the Model-View-Controller framework used in Smalltalk-80.</P>

<P>This loose coupling of objects is one of the defining characteristics
of systems built with CORBA or COM/DCOM where dependant objects may exist
in different process on the same machine, or on a different machine separated
by a Lan or Wan. In the context of a distributed environment, many of the
issues dealt with by Observer become far more complicated, for example:</P>

<LI>Local mapping of subjects to observer may become prohibitively expensive
when there are many observers with complex references for each subject</LI>

<LI>Observers and subjects may appear and disappear unpredictably</LI>

<LI>Point-point update notification from subject to observer may become
prohibitively expensive when there are many observers with complex references
for each subject</LI>

<P>New issues are also introduced such as the synchronisation of subjects
and observers operating asynchronously.</P>

<H2>Purpose and objectives</H2>

<P>The purpose of this working group is to explore the issues of consistent
state and synchronisation in distributed environments. The type of questions
we'll deal with include:</P>

<LI>What mechanisms can we use for notifying changes to interested observers?
When is one of these more appropriate that another?</LI>

<LI>What are the security and validation issues of synchronisation between
collaborating distributed objects (particularly over and intranet or the
Internet)?</LI>

<LI>What are the issues of load balancing and reliable notification?</LI>

<LI>What are the implications of distributed transaction processing in
ensuring consistent state and synchronisation?</LI>

<P>In answering these and other questions we will look to formulate a skeleton
pattern language or design-decision tree (DDT). This language or DDT will
attempt to capture the shared knowledge and experiences of the working
group in solving these problems. This language or DDT will form the basis
of a poster for the conference and will be distributed to all members of
the group following the conference.</P>

<H2>Taking part</H2>

<P>In order to join this working group you need to submit a position paper
to one of the <A HREF="#leaders">sessions leaders</A>. Possible form for
this paper include: an experience report, a set of requirements for distributed
object synchronisation in a system, or a list of questions and partial
answers. A typical paper would be between 3-10 pages long and would contain
some indication of the authors experience in this area (which might be
none, some or lots!) and the specific issues they want to deal with in
the group. Papers should be emailed to one or both of the <A HREF="#leaders">session
leaders</A> by 20th March in either plain text, html or pdf format, and
will be distributed to all members of the group 2-3 weeks before the conference
takes place.</P>

has, with Bruce Anderson, run two successful workshops on 'Design Variation
and Architecture' at previous Object Technology conferences. Paul has also
presented papers and posters on patterns and architecture at a number of
international conferences including OOPSLA and OOP. Paul has recently joined
Cumulus Systems Ltd., a software house that develops systems for the financial
sector. Cumulus is currently developing an integrated front and back office
product in a totally OT-based environment based around a CORBA ORB, ODBMS
and Smalltalk.</P>
