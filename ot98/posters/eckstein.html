<B><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="CENTER">A Paradigm Shift in Teaching OOT</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Itís still hard to teach OT, because all the people dealing with OT in analysis, design and programming have to make a paradigm shift for learning OO. But: <I>Learning OT is hard, because we educators still havenít made the paradigm shift in teaching.</I> The way we taught structural thinking doesnít work for teaching OO. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recipe for the paradigm shift so far: </P>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Use <U>Pedagogical Patterns</U>; These patterns have to be:</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>extensible - they should give the educator the freedom to go in depth in different parts without breaking the pattern</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>flexible - they should allow to react on students feedback</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>fixable - they should allow to clarify an upcoming problem without leading to the next problem</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Teach through Reflection in Learning (first introduced by Bruce Anderson)</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>treat the students as self responsible objects, which interact with another. The students are triggered by the educator to teach themselves.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Empower in Communication</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>teach the right thing - take the expectations serious by delivering the knowledge without forcing illusions or loosing yourself in the task</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>teach the thing right - be attentive to the students, or rather meet them where they are.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>support the next thing - make it easy for students to grasp the whole picture about the topic</LI></P></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Probably other educators from industry and academia are knowing of even more parts or variants of the above, which are necessary to make the paradigm shift in teaching.</P></FONT></BODY>
