	<FONT SIZE=4>Think-Tank</FONT>

<H1>Subject Matter:</H1>
	<FONT SIZE=4>The combination of intranet, internet and object technology offers

	to that promise from the current state of &quot;write here, crash there&quot;
	applications?<P>

	Users of a collaborative development environment may leverage on 
	this technology to call on remote experts to assist them in the 
	development of applications - this session will discover what
	features such an environment requires.</FONT>
