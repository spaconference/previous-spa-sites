The Java Beans Object Model</H1></CENTER>

<CENTER>Wednesday 8 April 10:15-13:15</CENTER>

Introduction</H2>
Java Beans is the object model for Java. It provides a standard API for
creating reusable software components that can be manipulated visually
or programmatically by other software, including builder tools and code
generators.

<P>Java objects can be introspected by the Introspection API to determine
their properties, attributes, produced events and consumed events. Attributes
are determined by the presence of <I>getX()</I> and <I>setX()</I> methods,
produced events by the presence of methods that register <I>Listeners</I>and
consumed events by determing which <I>Event Listener</I> interfaces are
implemented.

<P>Any class can be a Bean by implementing the APIs as per the Object Model
definition, as are all of the classes in the JDK1.1 standard packages.
In addition, objects that have not been wriiten to these standards can
also be made into Beans by the addition of <I>BeansInfo </I>and, if required,
specialised <I>Property Editor</I> classes.
<H2>
Who Should Attend?Ý</H2>
The workshop will be relevant to Java developers of any level of experience.
Previous knowledge of Java Beans is not assumed. If you have experience
of other component and object models (such as COM/ActiveX) you will find
it useful to compare the features of Java Beans.
<H2>
Workshop Structure</H2>
This workshop will cover:
<UL>
<LI>
Java Beans basics:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
The Java Beans object model and the role of Introspection</LI>

<LI>
Event handling</LI>

<LI>
Bound Properties</LI>

<LI>
Property Editors</LI>

<LI>
JAR Files</LI>
</UL>
Ý
<LI>
Advanced Java Beans:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
Activation Framework</LI>

<LI>
InfoBus</LI>

<LI>
Java Beans and CORBA</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
Presentations of key aspects of the API will describe Java Bean's features
and explain the thinking behind the component object model. These will
be combined with&nbsp; exercises where example beans will be created for
use in various scenarios.
