<h1>Software in Practice</h1>
<h2>June 22nd 2022 - Leeds</h2>
<p class="banner">SPA 2022 is now over, thank you to everyone who participated by submitting a talk, giving a talk, or who came to the event online or in person.  See you next year!</p>
<p>
Following last year's online event, we have decided that 2022 is the year to bring SPA back in face-to-face format, so we will be running a one day event this year, full of sessions on modern software development topics, in the best SPA tradition
</p>
<p>
The conference will be a single track event, presented by a group of expert and engaging speakers, on <b>22nd June 2022</b>, at the <a href="https://www.stgeorgescentreleeds.org.uk">St George's Centre</a> in the <a href="https://www.stgeorgescentreleeds.org.uk/find-us.html">heart of Leeds</a>.
</p>
<p>The event starts at 10:30 and will run until about 18:30, including lunchtime and breaks.</p>
<p>
We have a terrific lineup of speakers on the programme, covering a very varied range of topics:
</p>
<ul id="speakers">
  <li><b>Quintin Balsdon</b> who will show us how thinking about accessibility can improve more than just the user interface</li>
<li><b>Pradeep Bhadani</b> teaching us how to use Terraform to automate build and test of cloud infrastructure</li>
  <li><b>Keith Braithwaite</b> talking about what we lost when XP won</li>
  <li><b>Chris Cooper-Bland</b> who will explain why we need to think about more than just the functions of a product</li>
  <li><b>Natalia Oskina</b> who will tell us why we should be listening to the shiest person in the room</li>
  <li><b>Andy Parker</b> who will show us how an outage is actually an opportunity to understand more
</ul>
<p>Full details of the talks are on the <a href="programme.html">programme page</a>.</p>
