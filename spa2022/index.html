<h1>Software in Practice</h1>
<h2>June 22nd 2022 - Leeds</h2>
<p>
Following last year's online event, we have decided that 2022 is the year to bring SPA back in face-to-face format, so we will be running a one day event this year, full of sessions on modern software development topics, in the best SPA tradition
</p>
<p>
The conference will be a single track event, presented by a group of expert and engaging speakers, on <b>22nd June 2022</b>, at the <a href="https://www.stgeorgescentreleeds.org.uk">St George's Centre</a> in the <a href="https://www.stgeorgescentreleeds.org.uk/find-us.html">heart of Leeds</a>.
</p>
<p>
We are finalising the programme at the moment and we already have a terrific lineup of speakers, including:
</p>
<ul id="speakers">
  <li><b>Pradeep Bhadani</b> teaching us how to use Terraform to automate build and test of cloud infrastructure</li>
  <li><b>Keith Braithwaite</b> talking about what we lost when XP won</li>
  <li><b>Stefania Chaplin</b> explaining how to break down organisational siloes in order to change culture</li>
  <li><b>Natalia Oskina</b> who will tell us why we should be listening to the shiest person in the room</li>
  <li><b>Andy Parker</b> who will show us how an outage is actually an opportunity to understand more
</ul>
<p>
The final couple of speakers will be added soon.
</p>
