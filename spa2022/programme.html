<h2>The Talks</h2>



<h3>Tales of a button that wasn’t a button</h3>
<p><em>Quintin Balsdon, Spotify</em></p>
<p>
In this talk, I would like to propose that by using accessibility as a tool for refinement, engineers can be more engaged and decrease communication overhead between the different stages of the software development lifecycle. Through the introduction of accessibility metrics, designers, developers and quality assurance can all have a clearer perspective of what is required earlier in the development cycle.
</p>

<h3>Build and test cloud infrastructure using Terraform Modules</h3>
<p><em>Pradeep Bhadani, Cloud Native Technologies</em></p>
<p>
Cloud adoption across an organization is growing rapidly due to it’s benefit of elasticity and fully managed services. More and more organizations are migrating to cloud from on-premise systems, but building and managing cloud infrastructure in a reliable, efficient and repeatable fashion is a challenge.
</p>
<p>
Infrastructure as Code(IaC) is a process to manage and provision cloud resources using code templates. The values IaC brings to the organizations are majorly - cost reduction, speedy execution, secure & less error-prone systems.
</p>
<p>
Terraform is an open-source tool that helps to describe Infrastructure as code and it’s one of the most popular tools to build Cloud Infrastructure in a reliable and efficient way. Terraform has many providers available and can manage resources on different clouds like GCP, AWS, Azure, etc.
</p>
<p>
In this talk, I will talk about the Terraform modules and how to use them to build Cloud Infrastructure and accelerate the cloud journey. Terraform module allows teams to reuse the code and build infrastructure faster across the organization. As a software practice, testing is a key component when releasing code and I will demonstrate how “inspec-gcp” can test Terraform modules and gain confidence.

<h3>What lost when XP won</h3>       
<p><em>Keith Braithwaite, Co-Op</em></p>
<p>
We don’t hear much about eXtreme Programming anymore. Scrum and Kanban had better marketing, SAFe and other large-scale frameworks are more comfortable for large enterprises, all of them provide a better sales tool for consultants and trainers. But, maybe we also don’t hear much about XP because…it won. XP brought to the mainstream engineering practices derived from Smalltalk: Continuous Integration, Refactoring, test-first and Test Driven programming, collaboration by default in Pair Programming, collective code ownership, User Stories, and more. These have been incorporated smoothly into other approaches, and that’s great! Maybe some valuable things have been left behind. And that’s sad. We’ll consider what those might be, and how we might get them back.

<h3>There is more to a product than its features</h3>    
<p><em>Chris Cooper-Bland, Endava</em></p>
<p>
When you are shaping and developing a product it is easy to focus on the functions, after all this is what the customers constantly talk about. But there are other crucial aspects of a product that you also need to consider, such performance, security and usability to name but a few. These are the Quality Attributes (aka non-functional requirements) of a product implementation. However when you start considering these aspects of a product it can all get very complicated very quickly, causing people to back away slowly, as it is all too scary. In reality though, there are almost always a few critical quality attributes (CQAs) which really make the difference in any particular problem space, and it is these critical qualities that you need to identify, as they are usually hugely influential in the decision-making process. This session will discuss how to handle the identification of the CQAs, initially using case studies, and then some audience participation, to collect experiences of the importance of CQAs across different product areas.

<h3>What the shiest person on the team can tell you</h3>
<p><em>Natalia Oskina, Equal Experts</em></p>
<p>
The pandemic has changed our world and the ways that we work. Many of us now operate in a remote-first culture but due to the rapid transition, some subtleties of communication have been lost. Having left behind the traditional office, differences between characters have become more pronounced. Sometimes it is too easy to hide behind the screen; sometimes good intentions get lost through emotionless slack messages. While a team of just extroverts may solve some of these problems it would cause many others. This means that we need to find a way to make everyone shine.
</p>
<p>                 
This talk will focus on the ways to empower all members of the team and how effective communication can improve productivity. We will discuss the difficulties that team members may face with remote-first work and what we can do to avoid them.
</p>

<h3>From outage to understanding</h3>
<p><em>Andy Parker</em></p>
<p>
Outages, big and small, happen. It is how you respond in the moment and in the aftermath that really determines what the outage means. Do you use it as a challenge to figure out who (nothing you did!) caused the outage? Do you restore service and just get back to the real work? Do you use it as a chance to build a learning culture and learning organisation?
</p>
<p>
Incidents are intricate puzzles of the interactions between social and technical systems. Building a learning culture happens through the actions we take when faced with a puzzle. From collecting information to enquiring into knowns and unknowns to testing hypothesis and even acknowledging the value of different experiences everyone had of the same event. In this session I’ll take you through what I’ve learned over the years to transform these events from stressful, demoralising experiences to useful collaborations. Come prepared with prepared with a recent incident in mind and learn a new way to look at it.
