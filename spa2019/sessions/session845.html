<h1>Model Exploration Whirpool with EventStorming and Example Mapping</h1>
<p>Learn how to do model exploration whirlpool by combing EventStorming and Example Mapping</p>

<p><em>150 minutes</em></p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>People often ask for more concrete guidance on how to explore models, especially in an Agile or Lean setting. The model exploration whirlpool is Eric Evans attempt to capture such advice in writing. It is not a development process, but a process that fits in most development processes. The central theme revolving the process is to keep challenging the model. While the process itself for most is straightforward and easy to understand, there are not many concrete examples to find on how to do such a model exploration whirlpool. Most people when starting to use Domain-driven design (DDD) are looking for these practical examples. In this article, I will tell you my story of how I used the model exploration whirlpool by combining EventStorming, a technique that came from the DDD community, and Example Mapping, a technique from Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) community. <br />
<br />
In this hands-on session, we start model exploration with harvesting and documenting the current state. The primary goals are to collect reference scenarios, capture bits of the model and then leave most ideas behind. We do this with Process EventStorming. When we feel confident we harvested enough we add in the storming of Examples. <br />
<br />
Now that we acquired all that as-is we start storming domain events for the to-be situation. We finish again with examples, but instead of storming examples, we will start picking our business rules and start out example mapping journey from there. With our newly required knowledge, it is now time to start modelling. We first will explore different models and see how the models will hold up against the EventStorm and the examples on your example mapping. </p>
