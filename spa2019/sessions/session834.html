<h1>Practice makes perfect</h1>
<p>TDD katas to improve testing your domain logic</p>

<p><em>75 minutes</em></p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>I've been running kata's sessions in my team and in interviews for a while and I believe they can be a very useful exercise to improve the understanding of test driven development. TDD is a very useful tool if implemented correctly but it can lead to frustration and unmaintainable test suits if not implemented correctly.<br />
Understanding the domain, using a ubiquitous language, following the red/green/refactor approach are some of the pillars of a correct tdd implementation.<br />
Katas allow developers to practice the core principles of TDD again and again, until we are confident to have a good grasp of these principles.<br />
In this session we will go through one of these katas and we will learn together how to solve problems and how to approach them in the right way.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Session content:<br />
<br />
- introduction to tdd katas, quick overview of best practices, explanation of the kata that will be explored during the session<br />
<br />
- ideally group people and perform the kata in small groups <br />
<br />
- review some of the results , answer questions <br />
<br />
</p>

<h2>Audience background</h2>
<p>developers with an interest in TDD</p>

<h2>Benefits of participating</h2>
<p>better understanding of TDD practices</p>

<h2>Materials provided</h2>
<p>no material is needed , I will provide slides and we will use http://agilekatas.co.uk to choose a kata to implement.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>The session should start with a 15/20 minutes introduction and a presentation on the basic tdd principle we will use to solve the katas.<br />
Ideally in the next 40 we should then split up in small groups and each group should try to solve the kata , I'll provide guidance and help.<br />
The last 20 minutes can be used to review some of the implementations and Q&A.</p>

<h2>Detailed timetable</h2>
<p>00:00 - 00:15 introduction/presentation on TDD<br />
00:15 - 00:55 katas exercise<br />
00:55 - 01:15 review and Q&A</p>
