<h1>Iterating on domain models</h1>
<p>Get better at coming up with multiple models for a single problem</p>

<p><em>150 minutes</em></p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The first model a team comes up with often leads them down a particular path. That isn't much of a problem if the first model is any good. But often our first ideas aren't our best. How can you prevent bias towards your initial approach? What could you do to break free from the boundaries you first imagined? <br />
<br />
In this hands-on you'll be working on a single problem but you'll be forced to re-imagine it multiple times with different constraints. In each round you'll be limited in such a way that you'll have to get creative and come up with vastly different models for the same problem space. At the end you'll see what the power is of an enabling constraint. The Monday after the conference you'll know that with a little digging and thinking you can come up with entirely different models for about any problem space.</p>

<h2>Audience background</h2>
<p>- Open mind.<br />
- Beginners can get better at modeling<br />
- Advanced modelers can improve facilitation skills<br />
- All job types<br />
<br />
</p>

<h2>Benefits of participating</h2>
<p>Improve your communication skills; experience that your first idea isn't necessarily your best; learn how to evaluate alternatives; obtain tips for facilitating sessions</p>

<h2>Materials provided</h2>
<p>Written assignments per team; <br />
Materials required for modeling;<br />
Facilitation tips;<br />
</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>1. making connections between subject of hands-on and the daily lives of the participants;<br />
2. explaining the concepts (partly lecture, partly interactive within groups)<br />
3. practice modeling in multiple iterations<br />
4. group conclusions and retro</p>

<h2>Detailed timetable</h2>
<p>I'll do at least three try-outs at local meetups to find the detailed timetable. For now:<br />
<br />
- 00:00 - 00:10: Connections<br />
- 00:10 - 00:30: Concepts<br />
- 00:30 - 02:00: Concrete practice<br />
- 02:00 - 02:30: Conclusions<br />
<br />
</p>

<h2>Outputs</h2>
<p>All outputs will be discarded. Value was in the process. Attendees will get a hand-out with facilitation tips. </p>
