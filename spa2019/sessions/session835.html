<h1>The Road to Consumer Driven Contracts testing for SOA and Microservices Architecture</h1>
<p></p>

<p><em>75 minutes</em></p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Are you building a rich microservices deployment? If you are integrating your microservices into the rest of your microservices deployment then you experienced by now that classical approaches to testing systems End-to-End do not scale well for microservices due to environment complexity, slowness, and expensive setup. The other approach of mocking your dependent services provide you with no confidence while deploying.<br />
<br />
If you relate to these problems you will find it interesting to learn how to practice the Consumer-Driven Contracts pattern for a lean way of testing your microservices with the Pact framework to ensure APIs don’t break when different teams deploy.<br />
<br />
We’ll review the required DevOps related flows and dive to hands-on practical Consumer and Provider testing to demo how everything connects together for real life teams.<br />
</p>

<h2>Audience background</h2>
<p>Understanding the concept of testing and why it is important.<br />
</p>

<h2>Benefits of participating</h2>
<p>Individuals will be able to learn and build from my own experience on good and bad practices in implementing Consumer-Driven Contracts. How does it even work? they'll be able to introduce this to their teams at work or in their projects.</p>

<h2>Materials provided</h2>
<p>Workshop-style presentation and live hands-on demo of using Consumer-Driven Contracts in an end-to-end story from start to finish.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>Presentation to introduce the topic<br />
- Discuss bad practices, give examples<br />
- Discuss good practices<br />
- Discuss possible adoption model for agile teams that deliver quickly through CI/CD enablement<br />
- Semi-workshop small exercises to build together the Consumer and Provider tests </p>


<h2>Outputs</h2>
<p>An Open Source GitHub repository that walks through the entire exercise class step by step, with examples, and detailed README.</p>
