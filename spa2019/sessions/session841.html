<h1>Re-claiming the future of agile software development, from the past</h1>
<p>How the agile community could still be a force of good that drives software development out of the swamp of false promises</p>

<p><em>75 minutes</em></p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>CONTEXT<br />
-----------------<br />
Stories about epic failures in adopting heavy-weight "agile" frameworks, and their huge waste of money and time, are slowly spreading.<br />
<br />
The obsessive focus on scaled frameworks certifications in the job market is slowly fading.<br />
<br />
There are signs of a renewed interest in the key agile principles and the simplicity of the original agile frameworks and practices.<br />
<br />
QUESTION<br />
------------------<br />
How can the agile community be again a force of good, beyond ego, self-interest and marketing/sales ambitions, <br />
- driving the attention again toward the simplicity and the fundamental, genuine and authentic pillars of agile that work, <br />
- reinforcing the good ideas and practices lost and forgotten, and the important lessons learned after decades of practice<br />
- affirming, celebrating, and promoting the most promising lines of research and innovation in the field of agile software development?<br />
<br />
OBJECTIVES<br />
-----------------------<br />
This session is an open discussion among longtime agile practitioners with the aim to <br />
- find interesting answers to those questions, and <br />
- draft an action plan to involve in the conversation those agile thought leaders more active in supporting the community and advancing the craft of agile.<br />
<br />
NOTES FOR ORGANISERS<br />
-----------------------------------------<br />
While I'm comfortable in organising, facilitating, and summarising the outcomes of this session, to make it work I'd need the help of the organisers to ensure the presence of longtime agile practitioners and ideally getting in contact with some of them beforehand to start the conversation and provide a more advanced starting point for the session</p>
