<h1>Agile Technical practices coaching</h1>
<p>Sharing my experience working as a developer coach for the past 6 years.</p>

<p><em>75 minutes</em></p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In this talk, I will share experiences of coaching software engineers in agile technical practices. Specifically, programming practices such as TDD, refactoring pair programming and simple design. I will share how I approach coaching agile technical practices, what content I generally use and some of the materials and exercises. I will also go through some of the hurdles I faced when coaching, what has worked and what hasn't. Usually, in this session, I get a lot of questions so I will leave a generous time for Q&A. <br />
<br />
This talk is not about the specific practices. It's about how you as coach promote their adoption by individuals, teams and organizations. <br />
