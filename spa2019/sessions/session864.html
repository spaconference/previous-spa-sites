<p><em>150 minutes</em></p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Actions on Google is a new, exciting developer platform that lets you extend the functionality of the Google Assistant across over 1 billion devices, including smart speakers, displays, phones, cars, TVs, watches, headphones, and more. Not sure how to start developing your very first Action on Google? In this workshop, we’ll learn how to build the Google Assistant apps using Dialogflow and Firebase, test, and, finally, publish them. We’ll also explore the necessary concepts of voice user interface (VUI) and best practices for implementing Actions on Google that give users high-quality conversational experiences. No prior experience with the platform required.</p>
