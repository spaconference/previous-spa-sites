  <p>For about 20 years I've been writing software, delivering systems and helping development teams with technology, architecture and development practices. Currently working at Coop Digital in Manchester, I have worked for/with with Barclays, Tesco, Laterooms.com, the BBC, QA Training, LexisNexis, Microsoft and Sun Microsystems in various forms including developer, engineer, architect, development coach, trainer, author and consultant. I am particularly interested in the whys and wherefores of software development and how things really work for day-to-day development teams.</p>
