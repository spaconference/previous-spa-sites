  <p>Dave Aronson is a software development consultant, which means he writes code *and* gives advice about it.  He has about three and a half decades of experience, in a wide variety of languages, domains, techniques, etc.<br />
<br />
Currently, Dave is the T. Rex of Codosaurus, LLC (his one-person company, which explains how he can get such a cool title).  His latest passion project is to perfect and spread a new definition of Software Quality, currently called ACRUMEN.  His discussion at this conference will be about perfecting it.<br />
<br />
On lighter notes, Dave lives in Fairfax, Virginia, near Washington, DC, USA, is married, and is owned by two cats.  He also enjoys dark malty beers, smokey whiskies, playing guitar, and shooting targets.</p>
