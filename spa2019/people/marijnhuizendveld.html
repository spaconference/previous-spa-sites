  <p>In a small backstreet of Tokyo lives a man named Aki, a 78 years old former chef. Aki spent most of his life trying to perfectly cook the rice he buys from his friend Mato. He's been at it for 56 years now, and still searches for ways to improve his cooking methods. There is probably not too much anybody else could tell Aki about cooking this specific type of rice. When it comes to his process, Aki's understanding is unrivaled. <br />
<br />
Be like Aki, be your domain. <br />
<br />
If you don't want to spend the better part of 6 decades getting there, come and hear me share my experiences in the field of domain driven design and the lessons I've learned.</p>
