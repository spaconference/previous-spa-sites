  <p>You hire me when you want your path to agility to be inviting and engaging for all involved. I believe in us, humans, and the great things we can accomplish. Therefore I help organisations multiply the value they create by embracing the full power of the people in and around them. I do this through facilitation, coaching, training, and mentoring.<br />
<br />
I help management & development teams to be agile in their practices, with special attention to:<br />
* the opportunities for management and leadership to be a driving force towards agility<br />
* the opportunities to effectively include and unleash everyone in an organisation<br />
You can do much better than hoping management will simply step aside and the chaos will be temporary!<br />
<br />
My goal is lasting change, the kind people say they created themselves. I translate models to day to day actions. I inspire and encourage learning. I lead by example. I run and develop workshops and training (official Scrum.org trainings and beyond). I pair up with others to crack tough nuts together. I am certified as an Agile Master by the Agile Consortium, hold a degree in management, and have a background as a test-infected developer. You'll find me honest, transparent, passionate, and always ready for a fresh angle.</p>
