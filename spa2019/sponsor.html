      <h2>Why sponsor?</h2>
<p>Our conference has a long tradition of providing a supportive and engaged community to explore a wide range of the issues facing the development community today across the whole gamut of developing and delivering software. We are known for exploring the leading edge, new thought, experimental stuff. We go the extra mile to create a conference where you engage and participate in everything that we do. We aim to create an atmosphere where old friendships can be renewed and new ones made. Every year we see both the return of regulars and the arrival of new participants.
<p>SPA Software in Practice attracts many participants who are experts in their fields, and who often play a leading role in product and service recommendation and acquisition.</p>
<p>Becoming a sponsor of SPA Software in Practice provides the highest possible profile at the event.</p>
