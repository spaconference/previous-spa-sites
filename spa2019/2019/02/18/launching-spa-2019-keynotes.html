<p><br />Every year, SPA conference unites forward-thinking practitioners with a diverse range of speakers and facilitators. The goal of SPA is to find new and better ways to advance software development; the philosophy is to combine old with new. New topics that challenge us to look at software development in a different way, and new voices to invigorate the community with new ideas.</p>

<p>For 2019, we are delighted to announce our keynotes:  <a href="/spa2019/simon-brown.html">Simon Brown</a>, <a href="/spa2019/rachel-davies.html">Rachel Davies</a> and <a href="/spa2019/torgeir-dingsoyr.html">Torgeir Dingsøyr</a>. Simon is an independent consultant specialising in software architecture and the author of "Software Architecture for Developers", Rachel is a world-renowned expert in Agile approaches to software development, especially Extreme Programming (XP) and an author of the first book on Agile Coaching and Torgeir Dingsøyr is chief scientist at the SINTEF research foundation and adjunct professor at Department of Computer Science, Norwegian University of Science and Technology.</p>

<p>Between them our keynote speakers will be addressing some of the big issues around how we develop software today. Agile as it has gone mainstream has had to adapt to some of the realities of modern software development and our speakers talk to some of those growing pains. Torgeir takes a analytical look at the challenges of scaling agile as large companies seek to apply it to large scale systems. Simon reminds us that software design still plays a critical role in ensuring a well built system. Rachel gives us her experiences of working in a physically distributed team, an experience that happens frequently these days but is still not always approached with the conscious design that is needed to make it work.</p>

<p><br />If you have a curiosity for learning and you enjoy learning by doing, or you’d like to try a conference where sessions are interactive and engaging, we invite you to join us for SPA Software in Practice  on 24th &ndash; 26th June 2019 in London.</p>
<p>When the schedule is announced, expect to see a variety of topics. Some familiar, including programming languages, agile practices, and architecture, and some new, encouraging us to think more holistically about how we approach software development. Over the past few years, we’ve enjoyed topics including play in the workplace, knitting and coding, and The Chaos Lottery.
