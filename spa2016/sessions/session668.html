	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Finding the shortest path through a connected graph is a complex problem, and one which has a number of very useful applications.  Thankfully there are some efficient algorithms out there which solve it well. I’ll take you through some basic theory and how the A-Star algorithm works in the first part of the session.<br />
<br />
We'll then put your newly-found pathfinding skills to the test! We'll run a tournament for the remaining time, using a robot tournament engine. You'll be able to write a robot in any HTTP-enabled language, which will be one of two characters in a maze, and the idea is to find the exit as soon as possible without being eaten by the minotaur that roams randomly around it.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Audience background:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">- Some experience coding in at least one language is required. You must know enough to be able run code to connect to an HTTP endpoint and understand JSON.<br />
- You should bring a wifi-enabled laptop with your chosen language on it, or you could work in a team.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Benefits of participating:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">You'll have lots of fun and learn how pathfinding algorithms work and why they're useful.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Materials provided:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">A laptop running the tournament engine.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Short lecture at the beginning on pathfinding algorithms, then a workshop with people working singly or in teams on their laptops. They'll write code that connects to a server that'll run on the big screen, which will show characters attempting to navigate a maze with a minotaur in it. The team that reaches the end of the maze quickest, or who survives the longest, will win!</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>

	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>History:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Presented at Software Craftsmanship 2012 and at the BCS in January 2015, but I'm planning to rewrite the tournament engine between now and then to make it easier to participate.</td></tr>
