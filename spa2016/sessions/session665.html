Do you remember the last time you met a stranger and you connected – totally unexpectedly and with no hidden agendas? Maybe it was on the subway… maybe at lunch break – but it made your day magical.<br />
This session is not about learning new techniques and practices – there are all the other sessions for that. It’s also not about just another ice breaker activity. It is also not about another one of those techniques to build trust and enhance team work. It is about taking time to see and be seen. I believe that connecting to people is inspiring for us – and can be a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
 Inspired by a study I came across from the year 1997 (!) (Aron et al. The Experimental Generation of Interpersonal Closeness: A Procedure and Some Preliminary Findings), I have devised a set of games with different activities to get to know others - on different levels and different areas - and have fun doing it.<br />

After deciding on values upfront, people will be using different activities and games to connect to the other people at their table and have fun.<br />
Prerequisite are the following rules:<br />
• What is said in the room, stays in the room.<br />
• Value not judge. People have different values – and for this hour that is ok, we are leaving our judgements infront of the door.<br />
• Everyone can stay as deep or as shallow as they want. It has to be ok to say: I don’t want to share. <br />
• If any person in the group feels uncomfortable with a question/activity, the group moves on to the next.<br />
