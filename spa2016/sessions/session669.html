	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Many businesses perceive software development as a blocker. If only the development team could work faster and deliver software at the rate imagined by the wider business. However, what if their dreams came true? Imagine you had a development team that could deliver working software into production every hour. What would that mean for your business? Would your business be able to cope with it and what’s more, would it be able to capitalise on it? <br />
<br />
This workshop will explore the challenges that can occur when the perceived development bottleneck is removed. Kanban tells us when you remove one bottleneck this exposes others, so which ones would become apparent in your business? Will the new bottleneck be product management, sales, support or another part of the wider business? What problems would be exposed in those areas and how could these be addressed? Are these issues actually impacting your business currently? When all these things are considered, you may question whether development is actually your most pressing bottleneck. <br />
<br />
Participants will work in small groups to exchange thoughts and ideas, build them into a coherent viewpoint and present them back to the other groups.<br />
