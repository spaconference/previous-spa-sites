	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Geckoboard's small dev team was making little visible progress and was full of strife, despite a carefully curated backlog, 4 standups/day, and long planning sessions. In two months, we dumped the meetings and moved to continuous delivery, with most tasks defined, coded, and released in one day. We used Elephant Carpaccio and Action Science methods to jointly design processes, divide our work into thin, user-facing slices, and achieve internal commitment to the new approach. I will explain how we accomplished this, with a chance for participants to try out some of the techniques during the session. Attendees will come away with new approaches to both continuous delivery adoption and - perhaps more important - approaching the people side of technological change.</td></tr>
