<br />
By contrast, a project is, by definition, a temporary structure created to manage and deliver a specific goal. Some projects that were run using agile software development techniques have succeeded, and some have failed. What is it about the context, team structure and governance of those that succeeded (and what was their definition of success) compared to those that failed? Do projects even make sense in a truly agile software development context?<br />
<br />
This workshop will ask participants to explore whether projects are a good fit for software development. Participants will work in small groups to exchange thoughts and ideas, build them into a coherent viewpoint and present them back to the other groups.<br />
