	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Back in 2002, when this conference went by the name OT (Object Technology), there was a Sunday afternoon session that changed my career forever.  That session was called \\\"Naked Objects\\\", and was presented by Richard Pawson and Rob Matthews, who introduced their newly-developed (and to be frank, rather raw) Naked Objects Framework for Java.  You can read my bio as to what happened after that; abbreviated version, I now work almost exclusively developing naked objects apps, and it\\\'s a great fun.<br />
<br />
So this session is an opportunity for you to get started with Apache Isis, the platform that the original framework has grown into.  The objective will be to develop a small application of a handful of domain objects, but also to get to grips with Isis\\\' support for business- and developer-level tests, how the framework encourages modularity (through mixins and events), can be used as a REST backend for custom mobile apps.  You\\\'ll also learn about and integrate some of the various addons available (security, auditing, profiling etc).<br />
<br />
At the end of the session you should have a good understanding of the types of apps that the framework can be used to build; and you never know, your career might end up changing forever too!<br />

	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Audience background:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Technically, you\\\'ll need to be ok with Java, Maven and an IDE (IntelliJ or Eclipse or NetBeans).  You\\\'ll also need to have reasonably good modelling/design skills.  If you have only one or the other, bring a chum to pair with.<br />
</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Benefits of participating:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">* Learn how to use the Apache Isis framework:<br />
  - for prototyping (eg to elicit reqts/explore domain with business)<br />
  - for line-of-business enterprise apps<br />
  - for backend REST APIs (eg for mobile apps, microservices)<br />
* Determine whether this framework fits your own use cases<br />

	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Materials provided:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">We\\\'ll provide a set of examples and tutorials learn the framework\\\'s conventions, and we\\\'ll provide guidance and structure to get attendees to build their own app.  </td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">In the original OT2002 session the exercises were done teams of 4 or so; however working in pairs would possibly work better.  My thoughts are that the first 1/3 would be in running through tutorials singly or in pairs; then to have the attendees brainstorm some ideas for apps to build; then to pair off for the rest of the session to go ahead and actually build those apps.  The last 20 minutes would be a wrap-up to summarize what had been learnt and identify next steps, if any.</td></tr>
