	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">We often talk about being able to change our code fearlessly, but many teams still avoid changing the way their production data is stored, or 'refactoring their data', because they fear corrupting it in a way that will be hard to recover from.<br />
<br />
In this session we'll talk about a case study from our work at spabreaks.com where we migrated millions of attachments from a CouchDB database to Google Cloud Storage without our users noticing. We'll cover how minimised the risk to our data and load on our production systems by running both storage systems in parallel, and how we built a proxy so that the application manipulating this data was unaware of the changes in the way it was stored.<br />
<br />
After we've presented the case study, we'll lead a discussion around the more general techniques that can be used when making big changes to our production data, such as parallel running, monitoring and instrumentation, 'migrate on write' & log-structured storage systems.<br />
