	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Have you been asking yourself what Kanban is all about? Do you still think Kanban is just “having post-its on a wall”? Wondering how it could help you and where to start? Then this workshop is for you!<br />
We will go through the basics of Kanban, use some games and activities to reinforce our learning, and we will immediately practice what we learn by designing a Kanban system.<br />
You will walk away with a clear idea of Kanban and a good starting point to apply it to your situation.<br />
<br />
If you find that any of this is true for you then you will enjoy this workshop:<br />
- You’ve read a bit about Kanban but never really went through the basics<br />
- Your board looks like “To Do/In Progress/Done”<br />
- You feel like your team has stopped improving<br />
- You don’t get what WIP limits are all about<br />
- You’d love to use WIP limits but don’t know how to convince your team<br />
- You believe that being Agile is more than just following Scrum<br />
- You know Kanban but would like to see how to help a team get started with it<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Audience background:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Previous knowledge/experience with Agile helps but is not necessary. This workshop is for Kanban beginners. <br />
Typically this workshop would appeal to Scrum Masters, Delivery Managers, Team Leaders: people looking at helping a team improve.<br />
However, none of this is strictly necessary. The main requirement is that you’re interested in the topic. Everyone is welcome!</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Benefits of participating:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">You will learn the basics of Kanban. You will see what to do to help your team get started. <br />
We will play some games and do activities that you can reuse to explain these things to your teammates. <br />
You will apply what you learn by helping design a Kanban system (either for your situation or for a volunteer)</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">I will present the Kanban principles and practices. After an initial introduction I will go through each principle and practice, and for each one do a mix of:<br />
- explain the theory and what it means<br />
- use a game/activity to reinforce the theory<br />
- guide the audience through designing Kanban system for a volunteer to apply what we’ve just said. eg: when we talk about visualisation, draw your Kanban board; when we talk about WIP limits, decide your WIP limits; etc.<br />
- alternatively people can work on their own or in small groups to design their own system (although I would only recommend doing this if they have previous experience with Kanban)<br />
