<p>Agile Brewing with <a href="http://www.beerblefish.co.uk/">Beerblefish</a></p>
<p>SPA regular, agile enthusiast and beer fan, James Atherton, has recently set up a brewery using Kanban flows in management and brewing. He'll talk about how the process has gone for him and also let you decide whether iterative, flow based development of their beer has been worthwhile by bringing in enough to share around.</p>

<p>This should have something for everyone at SPA and will be a fun insight into how software development experience can translate into another industry</p>

<p><strong>Jurassic Park: What went wrong?</strong></p>

<p><em>"Dinosaurs and man, two species separated by 65 million years of evolution have just been suddenly thrown back into the mix together. How can we possibly have the slightest idea what to expect?"</em></p>
<p>In this talk, 65 million years in the making, Andrew Seward (@MrAndrew) and the audience will use Root Cause Analysis to follow a logical approach to figuring out what went wrong at Jurassic Park and propose some actions that can ensure the safe deployment of dinosaur parks in the future.</p>
<p>A lot of ideas are banded about in the 1993 film that suggest why things went awry, but that's not unusual when a there's a live issue. Following a methodical approach will show why these reactionary ideas are flawed, what actually caused the issues and we will hopefully learn some valuable lessons about how to deal with live incidents in our own systems in the future.</p>

<p><strong>About Andrew</strong></p>

<p>Andrew Seward is Head of Product at Cronofy, the Calendar API. He is also organiser of Tech Nottingham, a free monthly networking and knowledge-sharing event for software professionals and Hack24, the greatest coding event in the history of the world.
