	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">The testing community say the ultimate goal of a test engineer is not just to do your job, but to teach your team how to do your job, which empowers and enables them to achieve the same level of quality in your absence. To build up testing skills amongst testers and non-testers alike we’ve established monthly testing ‘katas’ at Red Gate. A kata is a practice whereby you repeat an exercise so that it becomes a natural action. The goal in these testing katas is to help us develop the conceptual tools and techniques of testing, as well as to appreciate the benefits of working closely with other people in our team. The ultimate aim is that the thought processes of how to test will be so natural that they can be executed and adapted to suit nearly any situation.<br />
<br />
In this session we will be running a test kata for you to come and participate in. We will have pairs test an application rotating every 5 minutes whilst verbalising their approach and reasoning.  The aim of the kata is to uncover issues in the application, covering all areas, from UI and functionality to fit for purpose.  We will then discuss the approach and findings as a group afterwards. The next pair should then be able to learn from what they have seen and build on the approach.   <br />
<br />
Through observing others you gain great insight into how others approach testing. This perspective allows you to identify practices that you can takeaway and apply, to enhance your own testing. As a side you’ll also see how effective katas can be in building relationships and sharing knowledge. We will share the findings from the testing kata on the conference wiki or similar. </td></tr>

Having co presenters will aid the discussion and allow participants to benefit from multiple perspectives.  There will be a short introduction to testing katas and the way we run them at Red Gate.  we will also identify other formats that they can take.  We will then introduce the application under test.  participants will be split into pairs and each pair will come up and test the application for 5 minutes.  At the end of this time we will discuss their findings as a group, it will then be the turn of the next pair.</td></tr>
