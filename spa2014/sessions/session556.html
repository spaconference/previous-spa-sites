	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">In this case study we will describe how a few katas we set up for some new starters in September 2012 quickly became a company-wide kata programme which we have been running ever since. We will examine the features of our current programme that we really value and describe why we think they are useful, and we will look at the things we've tried that have not worked out so well and consider why perhaps they failed.<br />
<br />
One of the challenges we have found has been generating a long-running supply of interesting and suitable problems. We will spend some time looking more closely at how we have gone about doing this. We will explain how we currently frame our thinking when setting a kata and how this has allowed us to set a wide variety of katas from a small repository of problems. <br />
<br />
Before we finish, we would like to open the talk up for questions and for you to share your own stories. <br />
<br />
If you've never considered running code katas at work, this talk aims to change that. If perhaps you've thought about it but you have not been sure how to proceed, this talk aims to inspire you to make a start. If you are already running your own kata programme, then come along and find out what we do and perhaps share what works for you.<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Audience background:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">This case study is aimed at people who have some experience of participating in code katas, and are interested to learn how they could be used as part of a development programme in their work environment. We will use a few examples that are based on C# code snippets, but you don't need to know C# to take part.</td></tr>
