	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">In September, I formalised an apprenticeship with a Computer Science undergraduate studying at the University of Bristol. The aim is to "fill in the gaps" in his studies with practical guidance and real-world experience in software development. In this session, I'll outline what we've been doing in our first year, and highlight some of the key lessons learned. The goal is to present a relatively simple and low-impact model for long-term software developer apprenticeships, and get participants thinking about whether they might like to take on an apprentice and how they might do it.</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">The session will start with me describing how the apprenticeship came about and the basic mechanics of how it works, and where we see it going from here after one year. Then there'll be a short demonstration of a remote pair programming session with my apprentice (Wi-Fi permitting... or a short video of one of our earlier sessions)</td></tr>

<br />
If any participants are interested in exploring apprenticeships, I'll be taking names for a potential event to connect mentors to apprentices later in the summer, or they can sign up to the user group I'll be creating for software apprenticeships.</td></tr>
