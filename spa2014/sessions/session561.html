<br />
We will define an extreme but very clear version of TDA and then attempt to use it in practice.<br />
<br />
Participants will be presented with a code sample that makes use of Maps and does not adhere to TDA, and then tasked to make it so. Tests are included to assist verification of any changes made, but perhaps some of them are more useful than others.<br />
<br />
Once we're happy that the codebase feels healthier (or at least TDA compliant), we'll try to add some more features. Participants will be invited to propose any particularly tricky ones to see how robust this approach is.<br />
<br />
Towards the end of the session, we'll have a retrospective, in the hope of generalising some of the specific knowledge we've uncovered into more general principles.<br />
<br />
Participants should leave this session feeling more confident in knowing when to apply TDA (and what to do when choosing not to).</td></tr>
