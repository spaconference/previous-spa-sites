None of us is as smart as all of us. -Ken Blanchard<br />
<br />
The Spa Conferences are places to learn and experience new things – it is traditionally a get-together of highly effective, skilled and experienced practitioners. <br />
In this session I would like to try out a format where we can harness the knowledge and creativity of the participants as well as our own to help get a new perspective on problems or situations that are puzzling us in every day life – or ones where we would just like to get a different perspective on.<br />
It is not really about getting and giving advice – the session is meant as a space of listening, posing questions, generating ideas – and practicing empathy – basically for one short moment „standing in there together“.<br />
<br />
You are invited to join the session if you fall into one or both of the following categories:<br />
a) you have a problem you are stuck with at the moment – and one that can be explained in a few minutes (specific technical problems probably won’t work ;-) ).<br />
b) you enjoy listening to people and helping enhance their creativity as well as joining them in a quest for ideas that might help – and you would like to practice these skills.<br />
This session will be primarily focussed on brainstorming toword ideas and solutions concerning situations the participants bring to the session – but we will also reflect on coaching skills.<br />

Then, we will ascertain how many participants have actual “situations” they would like to receive feedback to and how many particpants would like to practice their coaching skills and will divide .<br />
If there are more people willing to coach than want feedback, then we will practice coaching with prepared cases in a role-play format<br />

I think it would be a good idea to have the longer format so the roles can change and people get a chance at receiving and getting feedback.</td></tr>

a) a list of rules we agreed on<br />

c) feedback about the session format – how well it worked – and what could be improved.<br />
