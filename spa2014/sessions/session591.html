	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">George Bernard Shaw once said: "The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place." Peter Drucker said "The most important thing in communication is hearing what isn't said.<br />
Agile is about communicating - about understanding, listening, hearing - and then adapting to what was learned. And while I am sure most of us do know and practice the basics of communication most of the time - when the heat gets turned up... it can get more difficult to remember and put into practice what we know in theory. <br />
And this is what this communication dojo is about. Each game will focus on an aspect of communication skills that can be helpful in conflict situations. After a short introduction to such an aspect (such as active listening, the basics of non-violent communication, different personality types in dealing with conflicts, the model of the four ears, etc) the participants will have the opportunity to practice these skills.<br />
The goal of this session is not to introduce new ideas (although even the communication experts might pick one up :-) ) , but to consolidate and practice the well known ones - and to be inspired - either be a new idea or by rediscovering an old one.<br />

basically can be beneficial to everyone interested in practicing communication skills.<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Benefits of participating:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Communication is an essential part of our working life - and I think it can be helpful and inspiring to spend some time now and again, honing our skills in this area.<br />
Participants will benefit by <br />
- practicing and reflecting their communication skills<br />
- potentially learning new ideas to enhance their communication skills<br />
- hopefully being inspired for their practical working lives by at least one thought<br />
- having fun<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">This session will be an interactive workshop comprised of subsections of <br />
20 – 40 minutes - each with a communication skill training "game" focussing on one<br />
aspect of communication. I will bring along several different communication skill training games - and after starting out with one game focussing on basic active listening, I will let the group decide which aspects they want to concentrate on and devise the agenda with the group on the fly. I would like to let the group decide in order to be able to adapt to the concrete interests and backgroud oft he participants sponateously.<br />
Since the workshop is comprised as a collection of different games to <br />
practice communication skills, I am flexible as far as the length is concerned - a long tutorial would also be possible.<br />
