	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Asteroids is an arcade game in which you control a fighter that is bombarded by asteroids and attacked by flying saucers. It is a hostile environment that is ideally suited for Machine Learning.<br />
<br />
In this session we will provide a framework that will enable you to write the Artificial Intelligence of a (fleet of) fighters. A participant is provided with the means to extract sensory data from the asteroid fighter to provide as input to several machine learning algorithms, like neural networks and reinforcement learning, that will determine the behaviour of the fighter. It is your objective to score as many points as possible and outscore the other teams. <br />
<br />
Starting with limited possibilities in a controlled environment, a team's AI must complete objectives of increasing complexity to unlock the full potential of the Asteroids fighter capabilities. After completing the objectives, the full API is available and the written AI is transferred to the Asteroids arena in which other teams can be encountered. <br />
<br />
The constructed AI can now be expanded on, to create a squad of fighters that will roam the arena in search of points that can be earned by gunning down hostile objects. The controlled environment is still available and can be used to test new iterations of the AI, as well as running cycles to train the AI if the chosen algorithm requires it (e.g. Reinforced learning algorithms or neural networks).<br />
