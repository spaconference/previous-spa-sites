	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">There are many third-party programs which access cloud-based services (such as Dropbox, Amazon or Facebook) which are secured using usernames and passwords. However trusting such a program with your user credentials is risky: you have no way of knowing how the program will keep them secure, and no way of preventing the program from using them maliciously.<br />
This problem is known as cross-domain authentication, and one way of solving it is to use an open standard called OAuth. A client which implements the OAuth protocol uses a specially-negotiated key and secret to gain access to secured services or data. The program never sees the user’s credentials, which are submitted only to the service as part of the one-off authorisation process. OAuth also allows the server to restrict the services or data which the client has access to.<br />
OAuth is supported by a large number of cloud service providers, including Github, Dropbox, Facebook, Google and Amazon (see http://bit.ly/1hPBgT4). Many of these providers publish open APIs which allow you to use OAuth in your own programs.<br />
In this tutorial we will explain why OAuth is needed, how the protocol works, and how it is used in client programs. The tutorial includes a hands-on exercise in which you will implement a simple OAuth client to access the Dropbox file-sharing service. <br />

- General understanding of computer security (authentication and authorization)<br />
- No prior knowledge of OAuth is required.<br />
Participants will need a validated Dropbox account, and an Internet-connected laptop, preferably with the Dropbox SDK for their chosen language already installed.</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Benefits of participating:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">You will gain an understanding of the risks of sharing user credentials with third-party applications, and how OAuth mitigates these risks. You will also get the chance to build a simple OAuth client and walk through the OAuth workflow with a real service provider, Dropbox.</td></tr>

We will then move into the practical exercise, in which attendees will implement a simple command-line program to access Dropbox files having authenticated using OAuth. Attendees can work on their own or in pairs.</td></tr>
