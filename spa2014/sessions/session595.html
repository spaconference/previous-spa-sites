	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Code that is hard to maintain is a drain on productivity, manifested as reducing frequency of new or enhanced features of a system over time. As a well tested system should have two to three times more unit test code than production code, hard-to-maintain test code arguably has a greater impact than hard-to-maintain production code.<br />
<br />
Unit testing can get a bad name when even trivial changes to production code cause lots of tests to fail. A development team's natural reaction is to remove failed tests rather than fix them. Over time, this leads to a reduction in code quality as test coverage shrinks.<br />
<br />
For these and many other reasons, writing non-fragile tests is valuable. Based on work by Rick Janda at Zuhlke, this session aims to teach a few simple rules that make it easier, along with some refactoring routines to help convert legacy unit tests into less fragile ones (some of these involve refactoring the production code as well to make it more testable).<br />
<br />
Along the way, we encounter such entertaining concepts as the "awkwardness scale" of classes, "mocking hell" and how to escape from it, and DRY and SOLID tests.</td></tr>
