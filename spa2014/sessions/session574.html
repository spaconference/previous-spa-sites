	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Most teams (indeed, most companies) function better when all members are pointing in the same direction – decisions in the details can be more confidently delegated, ideas and suggestions from within the team to other parts of the business are more likely to be pertinent and helpful, and a shared direction often aids cohesion.<br />
<br />
Note that in this case we mean "direction" as distinct from "vision" and a more detailed strategy to achieve that vision. For instance, if a company's vision is "organize the world's information", with a strategy document for a given year setting various work streams to gather different types of information directly from end-users, the company's direction could be stated as "gathering personal user information in order to organize it for both personal and general use". Shorter than a full strategy, it nonetheless provides a helpful shorthand in a more concrete fashion than a vision statement. (It is worth noting that for some companies, their vision statement already set a clear direction.)<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, not all companies (or clients) will choose to set and communicate a direction in this fashion, and even those that do may not be practical for all teams – a sales team may well need a different, although still aligned, direction to a software development team. Worse, organizational deficits outside the individual teams can result in muddied communication, or even complete absence of clear vision and strategy, within which teams nonetheless still must aim to work as efficiently and valuably as possible.<br />
<br />
This session will start creating a type library of organizational structures that can impact on identifying and communicating a direction for software development teams, and different "coping strategies" that may be employed, along with some indication (albeit largely anecdotal) of potential attractions and risks of each strategy against each structure.<br />
<br />
For instance, the following structures certainly exist:<br />
<br />
• one single stakeholder setting a clear vision and direction [dictator]<br />
• one single stakeholder setting an abstract vision [dreamer]<br />
• multiple cooperating stakeholders [oligarchy]<br />
• multiple competing stakeholders [anarchy]<br />
<br />
Similarly, the following strategies certainly exist:<br />
<br />
• pass defined vision and direction unchanged to the team [identity]<br />
• interpret defined vision and direction in terms of the team's role within the strategy [interpret]<br />
• communicate only some subset of defined vision and direction [selection]<br />
• ignore defined vision and direction and communicate something else [override]<br />
<br />
Although we will not have time to consider all possible structures and strategies in detail, by tackling the subject in this fashion we hope to provide some general guidance and understanding in a space not conducive to formal research at this time, while still moving beyond the realm of mere anecdotes.<br />
<br />
Concrete examples from participants' experience will be shared under the Chatham House Rule, and not recorded in the session outputs, to encourage full participation and frank exchange of experience.</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Audience background:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Some experience of managing or guiding a team is required for full participation, likely in one of the following jobs or roles:<br />
<br />
• team lead<br />
• project manager<br />
• product manager<br />
• programme manager<br />
• product owner<br />
• business sponsor<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Benefits of participating:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Learning from others' experience, and going through the process of codifying and explaining your own experience, is intended to provide a more "front of mind" understanding of some of the techniques and approaches valuable in managing a team building software.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Materials provided:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Examples of both structures and strategies, and outcomes, drawn from my own experience as well as others from professional contacts. The intention is that even if other participants are uncomfortable sharing details, this should be enough anecdotal evidence to fuel a useful discussion.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Discussion of the different structures will happen in a roundtable format, giving all participants a chance to contribute, and which I will moderate and facilitate. If there are many participants, it would be possible (with additional facilitators) to break into small groups once an initial discussion has happened and everyone is aligned on what we're trying to achieve.<br />
<br />
The session is focused around structures, with strategies being discussed within the context of these, even though each strategy is likely to appear more than once; the bulk of the work in documenting each structure is about outcomes (including risks) of applying strategies, rather than merely identifying them.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Detailed timetable:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">00:00 – 00:05	introduction, ensuring everyone is clear about what we're cheating (in particular the distinction between "direction" and strategy, domain, metaphor and so forth)<br />
00:05 – 00:15	initial gathering of structures to discuss, and rough list of initial strategies (most helpfully, creating a shared vocabulary for the initial lists and putting them somewhere visible that everyone can refer to will aid subsequent discussion)<br />
00:15		discussion of first structure begins<br />
<br />
I anticipate the first structure taking around half an hour to work through; subsequent ones are likely to be closer to 15 minutes, allowing us to tackle three in this session. (If we break into small groups, this would be after some discussion of the first structure, so that everyone is on the same page.)</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Outputs:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">The type library, in draft form; if the feeling amongst participants is that this would be most valuable as a "live" evolving document, then it would likely make most sense to set this up as a wiki. As with all such libraries, a good index will be important in its practical use – this might make for an interesting poster presentation at the future conference.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top"><b>History:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">None; this comes from reflection on the various projects I have been involved in, as well as others I've heard about, prompted by a session on product management (and whether that should be a separate job, or a role distributed amongst the team) at a Many to Many last year.</td></tr>
