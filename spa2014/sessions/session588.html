What options are there? How do you get buy-in to explore such a programme? How do you make it work? What factors will kill it?<br />
<br />
Come along to this discussion session to hear what other people do, to share your experiences and have your questions answered.<br />
<br />
Objectives:<br />
<br />
Uncover variants of 20% time programmes, raise awareness of alternative programme models<br />
<br />
Share experience of what works and what doesn't work particularly around getting buy-in to start the programme, first time around, on-going evolution of the programme and possibly the slow death or closure of the programme.<br />
<br />
Dig into what value companies and participants get from such programmes<br />
<br />
Identify key success factors and pitfalls</td></tr>

<br />
I've done some basic research and identified about a dozen companies with variants of these programmes. Some of these have already published some success and failure stories so we have some initial themes and topics to explore - a big one being, what is the value of these programmes?</td></tr>

<br />
00:10 - 00:70 Facilitated Goldfish Bowl - seeded from invited folk with experience of such programmes. Easy kickoff would be to get everyone in the bowl to briefly describe their programmes and experience. Other questions will be generated by further research once the sessions has been accepted but could include - how to get buy-in, how to launch, who is in the programme and who is out (e.g. non-devs) and why, lessons learned each time the programme runs (if it's say one week a quarter), whether to focus on innovation or technical debt or 'sweating the small stuff'<br />
