	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Most enterprise applications are not very useful unless integrated into the system-of-systems within their host enterprise.  Such environments exhibit the classic “system of systems” characteristics of operational and management independence where each system has its own management, development team, operational environment and so on.  This means that making a significant business change often involves changing a large number of systems at once and that’s where the problems begin.  In particular, testing these cross-system changes proves to be terribly difficult for a range of reasons including differences in data, schedules, technologies, priorities and even philosophies between the various systems who are trying to coordinate an overarching change.<br />
<br />
In this workshop we will start by role-playing a group of applications trying to make and test a set of coordinated changes.  We’ll then draw on the skills and experience of the attendees to try to understand what makes testing “end to end” system change so difficult and then attempt to identify solutions to these problems.<br />

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Process:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">• A brief introductory presentation, simply setting the scene.<br />
<br />
• People are organised into working groups.<br />
<br />
• Role Play:<br />
   o Each group is allocated an application in a “front to back” scenario (e.g. Order System,<br />
      Processing System, Accounting System, Billing System).  Their scenario description will<br />
      explain how the systems are connected and the responsibilities and interfaces for their<br />
      system.  The scenario will also describe a change being made that affects all the <br />
      systems (e.g. “customers may now be international, not just domestic”)<br />
   o In isolation, each group (quickly) defines how they will perform their part of <br />
      front-to-back testing for the defined change from the perspective of their particular <br />
      system (i.e. “what do we have to do” not “what needs to be done overall”).  We will <br />
      provide a checklist of factors to consider to help to structure the exercise.<br />
   o We collect the approach from each group in typical SPA “flipchart at the front” <br />
      style – there will probably (hopefully) be significant incompatibilities and gaps <br />
      between them because each group will be thinking about their own application rather <br />
      than the entire problem.<br />
<br />
• Exercise 1:<br />
   o Brainstorm the problems with front-to-back testing in an enterprise multi-system<br />
      environment (stimulated by the role play)<br />
   o Refine the list of problems into categories and classes<br />
<br />
• Exercise 2:<br />
   o Identify practical and tangible mitigation strategies for each type of problem (technique,<br />
      management approach, avoidance, …).  In the interests of time, groups should focus on <br />
      one or two types of problems from Ex1 rather than trying to cover everything.<br />
<br />
• Presentations:<br />
   o Working Groups present their findings to the session<br />
