	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Abstract:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">In this demonstration, we will show how to build a basic testing tool in assembly language (Intel 64 bits) and how to use it to program a feature (probably "String Compare"). We'll rely on the use of Unix process return codes to display if our tests pass or not, and implement a red/green bar with Shell commands.<br />
<br />
This demonstration is intended to push the limits of what is considered doable with TDD. By doing so, we hope to make the audience realize that if it's possible to test-drive assembly code, it should be possible to test-drive anything.<br />
<br />
Also, we hope that some people will find it cool to see some live coding in Assembly and get inspired to do so themselves at home - and thus, contribute to hone the skills of the programmers' community.<br />

The audience is expected to have some notions of programming (stack management mechanisms a plus) and to be (at least tolerant toward people who are) kinky about exotic programming languages.</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>Benefits of participating:</b></td><td colspan="3" valign="top">Attendees will have the opportunity:<br />
<br />
- to refresh their knowledge about assembly language programming<br />
- to learn how one can test-drive their code while programming in assembly language<br />
- to discover how to build a (rough, simple, homebrew) TDD framework<br />
- to meet developers who like to have fun with exotic languages<br />
