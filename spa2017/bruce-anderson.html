<p>
Bruce led the design of the first SPA conference, where over a hundred people met in Cambridge for a three day residential. 
 </p>
<p>
That was in 1993, so this year is the 25th edition !
</p>
<p>
In this session we'll understand
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>The OT vision, the pre-history, the people - starting in the 1980s</li>
<li>The technical context and it's pressing concerns - from the 1970s</li>
<li>My own history and how this linked things - coding in the 1960s and tie them to your own concerns today</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Bruce Anderson has worked for 20 years as a university teacher and researcher, and 15 years as a consultant and software architect in IBM
</p>
<p>
He has worked in many kinds of organisation and many different industries, in many roles, but my abiding interest is in learning and "what practitioners know".
He also initiated a series of workshops on the "Architecture Handbook", playing a part in the early days of the Patterns movement. He has run many learning workshops, including several pan-European interactive events with a highly participative and empowering style for 160 participants
</p>
<p>
<q>I know that people love to collaborate and learn together, and from each other, when they are free to do so - free from unnecessary pressure and free from false models of learning and knowledge. Such people enjoy life and work productively.</q> - Bruce Anderson </p>
