  <p>I am the Enterprise Architect for ICBC Standard Bank in London. I work with senior business and IT colleagues to understand their business objectives, business capabilities and the existing technology landscape, and to develop and articulate the current- and target-state enterprise architecture.<br />
<br />
Prior to this, I worked for Barclays Investment Bank as the Architect for Rates IT and Control (regulatory reporting) where my remit included ownership of the architectural blueprints for my areas, working with projects and teams on their architectural designs, facing off to other parts of the company and externally, and defining and running architectural governance. I have also worked in technical architecture roles for Barclays Global Investors and Marks and Spencer.<br />
<br />
I started my career as an IT consultant for employers including The French Thornton Partnership, Cap Gemini Ernst & Young, Sybase Professional Services, Praxis and Logica. Over the years I took development and design roles on projects for a wide range of public and private sector clients.<br />
<br />
I have written a book on software architecture with EoinWoods. It's called "Software Systems Architecture" and you can find out about it here: <a href="http://www.viewpoints-and-perspectives.info/">http://www.viewpoints-and-perspectives.info/</a><br />
<br />
I play first violin for the [<a href="http://kcomusic.org">http://kcomusic.org</a> Kingston Chamber Orchestra] (for whom I am also the Webmaster). We rehearse weekly and perform three or four concerts a year. Our repertoire ranges from the Baroque period through to the twenty-first century, including some specially-commissioned pieces.<br />
<br />
I am also a school governor (former chair) and an Urgent Action letter writer for Amnesty International.<br />
<br />
I am a CEng (Chartered Engineer) and FBCS (Chartered Fellow of the British Computer Society).<br />
