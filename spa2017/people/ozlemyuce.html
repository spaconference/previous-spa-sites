    <a href="http://">    <em>Agile At Heart Ltd.</em>
    </a>  </p>

  
  <p>Özlem works with teams to quickly develop products and services that truly delight customers. With 15 years experience working in e-commerce, software and product development she has worked with everything from Fortune 500 behemoths to fast-growing Inc 5000 startups. Özlem has a degree in Economics and has lived in 7 different countries —including 5 years in Denmark working for Maersk. <br />
<br />
Along the way, Özlem has engaged with all sorts of organisational cultures and loves helping them learn and improve. She also enjoys sharing her experience with others and regularly speaks and delivers workshops at international conferences. She recently co-authored an IEEE paper called “Black Swan Farming” on the use of Cost of Delay at a Fortune 500 company. Her speaking schedule and things she has written can be found on her website agileatheart.com. <br />
<br />
When she's not jetting around the world consulting, teaching and speaking, she likes reading and going surfing. Once a year, for some unknown reason, she is glued to the Eurovision Song Contest.<br />
<br />
Most of all though, she loves bringing people together and helping them change the way they work – so they love what they do.<br />
