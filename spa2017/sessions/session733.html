<p>Introduction to Non Verbal Communication</p>

<a href="/spa2017/formats.html">talk</a>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><br />
As agile practitioners - whether you are a developer, tester, scrum master or product owner, we know that it is ALL about communication, right?  But how much of what we say and what we hear is words?  If, as much as 93% of our communication is non-verbal how can be sure we are 'saying' or 'hearing' the right thing?<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Non-Verbal Communication is sometimes referred to as Body Language, although it does include more than that.  This session is designed to give you a gentle introduction to this field, help you recognise some common behaviours, and show you how to start using this every day.  We will look at some basic indicators the may mean the person you are looking is feeling uncomfortable, is feeling shut-down in the conversation, or that might help you understand how confident the person speaking is about what they are saying.   It will not give you a tick list of behaviours that indicate lying or cheating!<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
These skills are a starting point for a journey that could keep you engaged for the rest of your life, and enrich your interactions with people both at work and at home.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
If part of your role includes communication with human beings, you need to know this stuff.  What is exciting, is just how much you probably already know.... </p>
