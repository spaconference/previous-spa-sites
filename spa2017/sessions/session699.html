<p>Tutorial on TDD'ing performance characteristics of code using new unit testing techniques.</p>

<a href="https://www.spaconference.org/spa2017/formats.html">Tutorial (75 or 150mins)</a>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>TDD can give us a lot of information about functional correctness of a software system, but the way it is generally used currently cannot give much information on the performance characteristics of the implemented system. We typically do not find out about performance problems until the whole system is tested together, or worse, when it fails in production.<br />
<br />
In this session we introduce new techniques for constructing unit tests that allow us to explore performance characteristics and detect problems before deploying the software. We can use virtual time to run performance experiments without waiting for real time to elapse, so we can get the fast feedback we are used to from the TDD cycle.<br />
<br />
We will explain the techniques and provide some exercises for participants to try them out using our new tools. <br />
<br />
The tools and techniques present are based on adapting academic performance modelling and measurement work to a more practical context, allowing developers to harness it in their day to day development process.<br />
<br />
(we have put 3 leaders on this proposal who have had input to the work, but likely at most 2 would attend the conference to present the session if accepted).</p>

</p>

<h2>Materials provided</h2>
<p>An interactive talk, plus code examples and tools for people to try.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>Pair-programmed work on exercises, interspersed with short presentation segments for introduction and explanation.</p>

<h2>Detailed timetable</h2>
<p>Tutorial, alternating presentation with paired exercises. <br />
<br />
