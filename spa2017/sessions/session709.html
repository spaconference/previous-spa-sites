<p>Sharing of lessons learned from creating Big Balls of Mud and how to avoid them going forward</p>

<a href="https://www.spaconference.org/spa2017/formats.html">Case study</a>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A journey through common ways web applications are architected and the typical problems they encounter during their lifetimes. Where should the business logic live and how do we stop it from leaking into the UI or even worse data access? We've all seen stored procedures that do more than query or update but perform complex business calculations.<br />
																			In this session we'll look at different examples of good and bad web application architectures from real-world experiences and why you might consider using Onion\Hexagonal to address problems like coupling and separations of concerns as we strive for a clean architecture.<br />
<br />
We work through three different styles reviewing their pros and cons. </p>

<h2>Audience background</h2>
<p>Aimed at intermediate\advanced developers<br />
Examples will be in .NET though the theory is agnostic</p>
