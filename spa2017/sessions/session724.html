<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In today\'s fast-changing environments, you face an increasingneed to get things done fast with a high level of collaboration and yet people around you simply don\'t step up and take responsibility. Thanks to field research around responsible behavior, conducted the last 25 years on the front-lines of leadership, CEO\'s, managers and coaches world-wide, execution times are slashing while fundamentally increasing sanity, happiness and profitability.<br />
<br />

We will explain you the 3 keys to responsibility and how to gain power in the situation at hand in order to be able to face problems as they arise.<br />
