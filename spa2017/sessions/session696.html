<p>Testing Your Team's Resilience Before You Have To Rely On It</p>

<a href="http://www.spaconference.org/spa2017/formats.html">Case Study</a>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A system's resilience is tested by stressing it under controlled conditions to find where it will fracture first. Finding where a system is weak before an emergency happens allows us to prepare & mitigate better. This is true of any system, including an agile team.<br />
<br />
We know teams with good habits such as TDD, SOLID principles, pair working, D.o.D., low WIP limits etc. are successful. Intellectually teams know they are a good idea...but... the human brain is a tricky thing, and habits are hard to change.<br />
<br />
A GREAT team does these things because its habit. It's just what they do. Every time.<br />
<br />
A GOOD team USUALLY does these things, but ....there are often reasons they don't. It's not a habit.<br />
<br />
Showing a 'good' team where they need to improve can be difficult. They may even be in denial any improvement is needed.<br />
<br />
We know people learn best when can they fail without fear.<br />
<br />
Enter the Chaos Lottery.<br />
<br />
1 person in the team wins the Chaos Lottery! For a set time they withdraw from contact with their team, immediately & with no handover.<br />
<br />
- If the team practise pair working, they know where the work is up to & finishing off without the lottery winner is no problem.<br />
<br />
- If the team check code in often, there is no big chunk of inaccessible work - all but the very last bit is checked in.<br />
<br />
- If developers and testers work closely, & the tester was the Chaos Lottery ticket winner, the rest of the team know how to continue with out her/him<br />
<br />
Inspired by NASA astronaut training for solving complex, evolving problems on the fly, the Chaos Lottery is one approach to testing an agile team's resilience.<br />
<br />
This is a meta-story about knowing what you should do (test your teams' resilience), designing a mechanism to do that (the Chaos Lottery) and finding that when our 'emergency situation' happened, we still hadn't quite been prepared! </p>

<h2>Audience background</h2>
<p>Basic understanding of good agile & XP practices, although experience of them is not necessary.</p>

<h2>Benefits of participating</h2>
<p>An understanding of why building good habits within agile teams is critical.<br />
An understanding that we are all human, and good intentions are not enough!<br />
An understanding that team members will take the path of least resistance to get the job done, and that won't always be apparent.<br />
Detailed instructions on how to run your own Chaos Lottery if you want to.<br />
</p>

<h2>Materials provided</h2>
<p>Materials for creative thinking activity</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>This is largely a story-telling session, but during the story the audience will get to discuss what they think happens next.<br />
<br />
Exercise to show how hard it is to train creative problem solving, with short reflection afterwards</p>

<h2>Detailed timetable</h2>
<p>00:00 - 00:20 talk with small amount of audience interaction<br />
00:20 - 00:45 creative problem solving exercise <br />
00:45 - 00:60 talk with some audience interaction<br />
00:60 - 00:75  questions and discussion</p>
