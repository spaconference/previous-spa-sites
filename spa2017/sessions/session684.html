<p>Learn how to prioritise refactorings in a smelly codebase</p>

<a href="https://www.spaconference.org/spa2017/formats.html">Workshop, 150 minutes</a>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The REFACTOR step in TDD is deceptively simple: you just have to improve the code, without changing what it does, right?  And the experts make it look so easy: "Look", they say, "here's some duplication, which I will remove by <insert magic incantation here>".<br />
<br />
But how should you decide which duplication to remove first? What happens if you fix the "wrong" smell? And how do you even see that duplication in the first place?<br />
<br />
In this workshop you will learn the value of Coupling as a practical tool to help plan and manage refactoring. You will explore a smelly codebase using Connascence -- an objective approach to discovering and measuring the important Coupling in an application. You won't be writing any code, but please bring a laptop so that you can download the sample code and navigate it using your preferred IDE.</p>

<h2>Audience background</h2>
<p>Everyone should come armed with the tools needed for exploring the code of an application. Participants should be programmers familiar with either Java, C# or Ruby.</p>

<h2>Benefits of participating</h2>
<p>Participants will gain introductory exposure to the use of Connascence as a tool for planning refactoring. We will explore various types of Connascence and various properties of Connascence that help in deciding "what to fix first".</p>

<h2>Materials provided</h2>
<p>We provide:<br />
<br />
- a github repository containing 3 equivalent versions of a smelly application, one each written in Java, C# and Ruby<br />
- detailed information sheets to guide the participants in their hunt for connascence in this code</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>Participants will work in pairs or small groups to create coupling diagrams of the given codebase. Groups will share and present these to each other towards the end of the workshop.</p>

<h2>Detailed timetable</h2>
<p>00:00 - 00:15 Introduction<br />
00:15 - 00:30 Divide into groups; clone the repo; ensure it builds and runs<br />
00:30 - 00:50 Workgroups create module dependency diagrams for the codebase<br />
00:50 - 01:00 Brief introduction to connascence (with slides)<br />
01:00 - 01:40 Workgroups each hunt for 2 given types of connascence in the code<br />
01:40 - 02:10 Workgroups present their findings to the room<br />
02:10 - 02:30 Whole room discussion comparing and prioritising the connascence</p>

<h2>Outputs</h2>
<p>We will share coupling diagrams of the codebase with participants after the session</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>We tried this session at CodeCraftConf in September 2016. It was received well, but at 2 hours felt a little rushed. As such, we didn't have time for much discussion at the end.</p>
