<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>You were told that Extreme Programming (XP) is suitable only for co-located teams, right? That's not always the case!<br />
We will demonstrate how our team is applying XP while being distributed between Paris and Beirut!<br />
How we took XP one step further by applying pair programming and retrospectives in a remote mode.<br />
We will go through the major obstacles we faced and how we managed to overcome them.<br />
We will have a live demo of remote pair-programming and retrospectives.<br />
By the end of the session, you should have a pretty good idea how to start applying XP practices in a multi-site team.<br />
Remarks<br />
<br />
As software collaboration is becoming more and more distributed either through distributed companies or freelancers; remote programming is becoming the norm between developers! The purpose of this talk is to show how our team at Murex managed to adopt Extreme Programming in a distributed mode for the past three years. The presentation will cover the main obstacles encountered and how the team managed to solve them.<br />
The talk will include two live demos; one on remote pair programming and another on remote meetings and retrospectives!<br />
<br />
We gave this talk last October at AgileTour Beirut, and we received very positive feedback after the session. Because the session in Beirut was filmed and uploaded on youtube, we will be able to improve parts of it for later use!<br />
The agenda of the talk will be as follows:<br />
- Presenters' Introduction<br />
- Present eXtreme Programming and some of its practices<br />
- Pair Programming & Retrospective Meetings in local setup<br />
- Pair Programming & Retrospective Meetings in remote setup<br />
- Difficulties and challenges we are facing<br />
- Answering Questions<br />
<br />
You can find below more details from our previous talk:<br />
