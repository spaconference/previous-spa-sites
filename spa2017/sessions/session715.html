<p>An introduction to the concepts, technologies, challenges and opportunities of blockchain technology</p>

<a href="http://www.spaconference.org/spa2017/formats.html">75 minute tutorial</a>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Blockchain finally appears to be shedding its image as an enabling technology for drug dealing to being the new technical solution looking for problems in every possible domain from diamond tracking, to securities clearing, to property registers to KYC customer checking.  Everywhere you look new possible applications are being thought up, even if few have moved into serious use yet.<br />
<br />
In this tutorial we will briefly review the fundamental ideas underpinning blockchain technologies and consider what problems its defining architectural characteristics make it suitable for.  We will get an idea of what it is like to work with blockchain technology by browsing a live blockchain and understanding how to develop and test "smart contracts" that provide blockchain with its secure computation abilities.</p>
