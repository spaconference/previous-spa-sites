<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>What does it take to get to a system where I can create a new service in just a few lines of code, and live with the result? In the transition to microservices, it’s critical to consider, and provide support for, the whole lifecycle of a service. Except that now it’s a fleet of services where there are just too many to manage by hand. In this talk, Giovanni and Steve will discuss some of the technical and organisational infrastructure that makes microservices work in practice.<br />
The goal is to share our experiences with working with microservices with the audience and give them some hints and tips on how to proceed if they are considering the use of microservices for their own projects.<br />
We will touch on the most important technical, organizational and process related aspects, e.g.:<br />
- Start from a monolith or directly with microservices?<br />
- Fundamental system properties: testability and supportability<br />
- Dealing with failures<br />
- Automation<br />
- Team organization: feature, component, or something else?<br />
- Requirements streams and teams<br />
- etc.</p>

<h2>Audience background</h2>
<p>Ideally, developers, testers, architects, and managers with an intermediate to advanced level of experience.</p>

<h2>Benefits of participating</h2>
<p>Get a better understanding on what to consider before deciding to use a microservice architecture, both from a technical and an organizational point of view, as well as some hints and tips on how to get started.</p>

<h2>Materials provided</h2>
