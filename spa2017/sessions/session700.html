<p>Presentation (and maybe tutorial) showing new refactoring tools for Java based on connascence.</p>

<a href="http://www.spaconference.org/spa2017/formats.html">Presentation + Demos / Interac</a>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>"Connascence is a way of describing the coupling between different parts of a codebase. And because it classifies the relative strength of that coupling, connascence can be used as a tool to help prioritise what should be refactored first." [1]<br />
<br />
Recently (particularly through the work of Kevin Rutherford) connascence in code (as originally described by Page-Jones) has become a topic of discussion and a mental device to help us think about and prioritise refactoring.<br />
<br />
Can we build automated tool support for this? If we could, how could that help us to identify different types of coupling and possible refactoring targets in our code?<br />
<br />
This talk (and hopefully exercises) will present our latest work on extending the ideas of Rutherford and Page-Jones and implementing tools to help developers. Helping them to navigate, assess and refactor Java code by identifying and visualising connascence.<br />
<br />
This is a different and separate proposal from the "Red, Green, then What?" proposal that is also submitted to SPA. The sessions have different leaders, but we believe that they could make a good pairing.<br />
<br />
N.B. This is work in progress (contributing towards a Masters thesis project), and so at the time of writing this proposal, the tools are not in a completed state - however by the time of the conference we are confident of having some results to present.<br />

</p>

<h2>Audience background</h2>
<p>Developers and Architects</p>

<h2>Benefits of participating</h2>
<p>Learn about connascence, and see how tooling can help us use it as a refactoring lever.</p>

<h2>Materials provided</h2>
<p>Presentation and (hopefully) a tool to try.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>Mostly a presentation. Minimally there will be demos, hopefully with some interactive element through mob-programming or pair programmed exercises.</p>

<h2>Detailed timetable</h2>
<p>This is a relatively short session, so probably a 75 min slot would be best, but if both are accepted it would be good to coordinate the schedule with "Red, Green, then what?"<br />
<br />
Suggested timetable:<br />
<br />
00:00 - 00:30  -  Presentation of ideas and techniques<br />
00:30 - 01:00  - Working on exercises using connascence-based tools to direct refactoring, either in pairs, or maybe better as a mob to save on potential problems of downloading and installing tools on all laptops<br />
01:00 - 01:15  - Discussion of the approach, potential improvements, wrap-up<br />
</p>

<h2>Outputs</h2>
<p>Article online, code on GitHub.</p>
