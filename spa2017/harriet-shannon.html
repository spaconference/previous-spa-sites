<p>
Creativity may be defined as the use of an original set of ideas to create something novel

and useful. But how do we generate ideas, and how can we optimise our chances of having 

a ‘good idea’ in the workplace? Research suggests that creativity can be enhanced by 

creating an environment that promotes a relaxed-yet-distracted psychological state.   
</p>
<p>
In this session, we will discuss the role of the ‘default mode network’ in creativity, and will 

participate in a number of repetitive craft activities, from pom poms to sand art, that will aim 

to support the delicate balance between external stimulation and internal perspicacity. We 

will harness the powers of ‘constructive internal reflection’ in an attempt to solve a 

crowdsourced, complex software engineering problem.
