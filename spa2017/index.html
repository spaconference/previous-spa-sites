<h1>About the Conference</h1>
<p>The annual BCS Software Practice Advancement conference brings together experts and practitioners to share the latest thinking in software development.</p>
<p>Now in its 21st year, our conference has a tradition of active participation. We encourage conference sessions that bring people together to work and learn and in most cases, many sessions are highly interactive, involving participants and session leaders on an equal footing. This results in a conference like no other and consistently excellent feedback from all those who attend.</p>

<h1>Monday Keynote </h1>
<p>We are pleased to have  Bruce Anderson for the first keynote at SPA 2017, and to kick off the conference with
<p><strong>Learning, geekery and small memories</strong></p>
<p>
Bruce led the design of the first SPA conference, where over a hundred people met in Cambridge for a three day residential. 
 </p>
<p>
That was in 1993, so this year is the 25th edition !

<h1>Tuesday Keynote </h1>
<p><strong>Knitting and Coding. Is that code or a bit of yarn? - Karen Shoop</strong></p>
<p>We are pleased to have Dr Karen Shoop join us for the second keynote at SPA 2017. Dr Karen Shoop is a researcher at the Queen Mary University of London

<p>This session explores the intersection of knitting and coding: how combinations of binary knits and purls creates predictable, repeating patterns; how the instructions of the craft world used to make objects – the knitting instructions – resemble programming instructions; differing, perhaps error-prone, output thanks to human processing; encoding with knitting. </p>

<h1>Wednesday Keynote </h1>
<p><strong>Use of a repetitive craft activity to solve a complex software engineering problem - Harriet Shannon</strong></p>
<p>We are pleased to have Dr Harriet Shannon join us for the third keynote at SPA 2017. Dr Harriet Shannon is a physiotherapist and senior teaching fellow at University College
 London.</p>
<p>In the session, we will discuss the role of the ‘default mode network’ in creativity, and will

participate in a number of repetitive craft activities, from pom poms to sand art, that will aim 

to support the delicate balance between external stimulation and internal perspicacity. We 

will harness the powers of ‘constructive internal reflection’ in an attempt to solve a 

crowdsourced, complex software engineering problem. </p>

<h1>Tuesday Evening Diversion</h1>
<p><strong>Build a laser bot for Cats !!</strong></p>
<p>
This workshop aims to create a laser bot for cats and it will cover every step of the process: from manually building the bot to programming the laser. Cats will be less bored and fat and we’re going to hack on something cool!
